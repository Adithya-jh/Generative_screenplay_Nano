TENET
Written by Christopher Nolan
 
ORCHESTRA TUNING, audience settling. High officials in glassed-in boxes toast each other. Doors closing...

BAM – from behind the orchestra – TERRORISTS with MACHINE GUNS BURST in... The audience SCREAMS... The terrorists cover the ordinary people – the HIGH OFFICIALS are held in the BOXES...

INT./EXT. VAN, PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV, UKRAINE – DAY
As POLICE FLOOD THE PLAZA, the DRIVER turns to the PASSENGER
–

DRIVER
(in Ukrainian)
– Wake up the Americans. –

The Passenger turns to the back where four BLACK-CLAD YOUNG MEN SIT, WAITING. The nearest one seems to be SLEEPING...

PASSENGER
Hey –

EYES CLOSED, the young man COCKS his weapon, chambering a round, POPS it out of the slide, CATCHES it, opens his eyes – this is THE PROTAGONIST...

The Passenger nods, ‘okay’. The Driver looks down at a VARIETY OF UNIFORM PATCHES...
SIRENS. The Americans shoulder WEAPONS, pull on HELMETS... A UKRAINIAN SWAT VAN SCREECHES to a halt outside the theatre
–

The Passenger spots its markings – TOSSES the corresponding patches to the Americans, who slap them onto their shoulders.

Ukrainian SWATs pour out of the SWAT van –

The Americans JUMP out of the back of their van, SLIPPING UNNOTICED INTO THE STREAM OF SWATS pouring into the lobby...

INT. LOBBY, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

SWATs mass at each entrance... the Protagonist watches GAS CANISTERS brought in TO THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM. The
SWATs pull on GAS MASKS...

INT. BOX, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

A WELL-DRESSED MAN sitting next to a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL looks down into the stalls – people SLUMP, UNCONSCIOUS, IN A WAVE...
 

He turns to the Official – who motions calm, draws a SIDEARM...

INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

A Terrorist wets a rag in a drinking fountain, ties it around his nose and mouth. Others have WORKMAN’S RESPIRATORS AND FACE MASKS. They COCK THEIR WEAPONS, preparing...

INT. LOBBY, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

THE SWATS BREACH – POURING into the theatre – exchange GUNFIRE with the TERRORISTS...

INT. CURVING CORRIDOR – DAY
RUNNING. Fast but silent...

FOLLOW the four Americans – they hit a junction – hand signals – they SPLIT two ways –

FOLLOW two of them – one of them PEELS OFF up a staircase – FOLLOW the last, the Protagonist – checking each box...

INT. BOX, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist BURSTS in – takes out the Official beside the Well-Dressed Man –

PROTAGONIST
We live in a twilight world...
The Well-Dressed Man stares, shocked –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
We live in a twilight world...
WELL-DRESSED MAN
(focuses)
And there are no friends at dusk.
PROTAGONIST
You’ve been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.

WELL-DRESSED MAN
But I’ve established contact –
PROTAGONIST
Bring you in or kill you – I have two minutes. Make up your mind.

The Well-Dressed Man nods, climbs to his feet...
 

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Where’s the package?
WELL-DRESSED MAN
Coat check.
He hands the Protagonist a numbered ticket.

INT. CORRIDOR, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The battle between SWATs and Terrorists rages... SWATS move down the corridor, checking the boxes one by one...

INT. BOX, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist SMASHES the glass – checks the drop to the stalls, pulls out a black rope, ties it to a column...

As they DROP, Terrorist gunfire rings out – they LAND – hiding amongst the UNCONSCIOUS AUDIENCE. The Well-Dressed Man takes a seat, FEIGNS SLEEP – the Protagonist ROLLS under the seats –

BLAM! Terrorists near the stage open fire – SHOTS ring out – hitting two sleeping audience members, nearby – the Well- Dressed Man TWITCHES – the Protagonist holds his ankle – urging him to keep still –

BLAM! A third sleeping audience member is shot – the Protagonist jumps up, DRAWING THE TERRORISTS’ fire away from the Well-Dressed Man –

The Protagonist races towards two REAL UKRAINIAN SWATS who cover him from the Terrorists – one of them goes down.

The Protagonist takes cover beside the real UKRAINIAN SWAT – WHO IS PLANTING A BOMB UNDER THE SEATS... he gestures to the dead SWAT’s pack... the Protagonist unzips the bag to find a BOMB, COUNTING DOWN IN SYNC WITH THE OTHER BOMB –

UKRAINIAN SWAT
(in Ukrainian, impatient)
– What’re you doing? –

The Ukrainian SWAT uses his gun to PROD the Velcro patch on the

Protagonist’s shoulder. It FALLS OFF...
UKRAINIAN SWAT (CONT'D)
(in Ukrainian)
– Who are you? –

The Protagonist is at a loss... BAM! The Ukrainian SWAT is taken out by another ‘SWAT’ –
 

‘SWAT’
No friends at dusk, huh?
PROTAGONIST
You’ll do.

The Protagonist GRABS the bombs, points at the Well-Dressed Man –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
(to the ‘SWAT’)
Get him to the rally point.
The ‘SWAT’ leads the Well-Dressed Man down a fire exit –

INT. LOBBY, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist RACES across the lobby, gunfire RINGING OUT – LEAPS over the counter into the COAT-CHECK AREA...

Landing on the floor next to an unconscious coat-check girl. He spots another bomb – ‘4:23’, ‘4:22’... the Protagonist checks the number on the coat-check ticket and efficiently moves across numbered racks until he finds a SPORTS BAG.

He unzips it to find a BLACK METALLIC OBJECT the size of a softball.

He stuffs it into his pack and SCRAMBLES over the counter...

INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

– the Protagonist RUNS, checking numbers on doors... he STOPS at a door, THROWS it open, JUMPS in low –

INT. UTILITY ROOM – CONTINUOUS

THREE ‘SWATS’, guns trained, and the Well-Dressed Man. The Protagonist throws a bomb to SWAT 2, then shows the OBJECT to the Well-Dressed Man –

PROTAGONIST
I’ve never seen encapsulation like this.

WELL-DRESSED MAN
We don’t know how old it is. It’s the real deal.

PROTAGONIST
Did you have an out?
WELL-DRESSED MAN
Service tunnels to sewers.
 

PROTAGONIST
Swap clothes.

The ‘SWAT’ and the Well-Dressed Man start changing. The Protagonist hands SWAT 3 the object –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Take this, take him, take his exit. I don’t trust ours any more.
(to SWAT 2)
Can you defuse it?
SWAT 2
(shakes head)
Centrally synchronized. Are there more?
The Protagonist nods, STUFFS the bomb in his pack – PROTAGONIST
Covering their tracks.
SWAT 2
Taking out the audience?
PROTAGONIST
Just the cheap seats.
SWAT 3
Not our mission –
PROTAGONIST
Mine, now.
The newly dressed ‘TARGET’ steps up –
‘TARGET’
I’m with you – the Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.

INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and the ‘Target’ race through the SLEEPING AUDIENCE COLLECTING BOMBS – the TIMERS tick down – ‘1:58’, ‘1:57’.

Crouched at a bomb, the Protagonist notices a BULLET HOLE in the side of the chair – a TINY WHIFF OF SMOKE GATHERING...

CLICK – a gun is to his head – he spins around to see a SWAT... ‘0:34’, ‘0:33’... The ‘Target’ has his own gun on the SWAT – A STAND-OFF – all around them, UNCONSCIOUS CIVILIANS...

PROTAGONIST
Walk away – you don’t need to kill these people.
 

The Protagonist turns back to the bomb... ‘0:32’, ‘0:31’. At the bullet hole the PUFF OF SMOKE THICKENS... the Protagonist, confused, REACHES towards it... the SWAT COCKS his weapon...

BLAM! With EXPLOSIVE FORCE THE BULLET HOLE DISAPPEARS – A NICK HAS APPEARED IN THE PROTAGONIST’S UNIFORM – he SPINS –
the SWAT is SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST AND DROPS... revealing a FIGURE, also in a gas mask and tactical gear...

The Figure TURNS – the Protagonist sees, on the Figure’s pack, a small TALISMAN – a COIN with a hole tied to a zip by ORANGE AND YELLOW THREAD – the Protagonist turns back to grab the bomb –

‘TARGET’
That wasn’t one of us.
PROTAGONIST
I’ll take the help.

The Protagonist GRABS the last bomb: ‘0:03’... he looks up to the boxes, where REAL SWATS EVACUATE THE HIGH OFFICIALS...
THE PROTAGONIST LOBS THE BOMBS UP INTO THE BOXES...

EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist and ‘Target’ emerge – an EXPLOSION above them
-

INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS
INNOCENT CIVILIANS STIR under the EXPLOSION IN THE BOXES –

EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS
The van PULLS UP – rear door open – they JUMP INSIDE –

INT. VAN – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist pulls off his mask. BREATHING. The Passenger turns – grabs the ‘Target’s face, SOMETHING WRONG... the Protagonist turns to the Driver – WHO HAS A GUN POINTED AT HIM ...

BLACK SCREEN:

SCREAMING. The Protagonist’s screaming. Close on his eyes – FLICKERING, SWEATING, PLEADING, DEFIANT... and we are –
 

EXT. RAIL YARDS – DAY

The Protagonist, tied to a chair, in a windswept rail yard. In front of him, the ‘Target’, also tied to a chair, back to us. The Driver steps back, SWEATING. BLOODY PLIERS in hand.

DRIVER
(breathless)
A man can be trained to hold out for about eighteen hours.

The Driver gestures at a CLOCK on a table –
DRIVER (CONT'D)
So your colleagues will clear by 7.

The Driver PUSHES the ‘Target’s chair over. The ‘Target’ lands hard on his side on the gravel. Groaning.

DRIVER (CONT'D)
He didn’t last eighteen minutes.
The Driver pulls out a KNIFE. Leans in to the Protagonist –
DRIVER (CONT'D)
But he didn’t have anything to hide. You were smuggling a nobody.

The knife moves towards the Protagonist’s throat...
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Risky.
...then to his collar – which he CUTS –
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Or were you counting on this?
...pulling out a SILVER CAPSULE. The Protagonist stares.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Death, CIA issue.
The Driver TOSSES the pill, WAVES the pliers at the clock –
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Spare yourself once they’re clear.

The Protagonist looks at the clock – ‘5:38’. A FREIGHT TRAIN RUMBLES PAST, CLOSE... As we close in on the clock, THE PROTAGONIST’S SCREAMS ARE DROWNED OUT BY THE FREIGHT TRAIN...

The Driver steps back. The Protagonist breathes heavy, blood dribbling... the Driver follows his gaze to the clock – ‘6:53’ – then checks his watch. Frowns theatrically, picks up the clock, SHAKES it –
 

DRIVER (CONT'D)
Running fast...

The Driver SETS THE HANDS BACK ONE HOUR. The Protagonist watches, DESPAIRING... as the Driver puts the clock back on the table, the Protagonist notices the ‘Target’s FINGERS WIGGLING... in them is a SILVER PILL...

Freight trains rumble past in opposite directions, sound BUILDING... The Driver approaches, bloody pliers in hand –

PROTAGONIST
We were alone.
DRIVER
I didn’t ask. Which means we’re finally getting somewhere.

The Protagonist HURLS himself onto the ‘Target’s hands – face SMASHING – gets the PILL into his mouth – BITES DOWN – DEAFENING TRAIN NOISE...

Arms GRAB at him – HANDS PRY his jaw as he SEIZES, MOUTH FOAMING... the Protagonist’s EYES GLAZE and we –

 


Black screen. Supertitle:
 





TENET
 
CUT TO:






FADE IN:
 

The Protagonist opens his eyes. A man stands beside his bed. SWAYING gently. This is FAY.

FAY
Welcome to the afterlife.
The Protagonist lifts his head and we are –

INT. BOAT AT SEA – DAY
The Protagonist sees the STEELY OCEAN SWELL...
FAY
You’ve been in a medically induced coma while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.

PROTAGONIST
The pills are fake?
FAY
We swapped yours for a sedative.
 

 

Why?

A test.
 
PROTAGONIST FAY
 
The Protagonist runs a finger around his mouth. REALIZING.
PROTAGONIST
Test? They pulled my teeth out.
Fay lets that dissipate. The Protagonist closes his eyes.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Did the team get clear?
FAY
No. Private Russians, we think.
PROTAGONIST
Somebody talked.
FAY
Not you. You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.

EXT. DECK OF THE BOAT – LATER

The Protagonist stands in the wind, contemplating the horizon.

FAY (O.S.)
We all believe we’d run into the burning building, but until we feel that heat... we can never know. You do.

 

I resign.
 
PROTAGONIST

FAY
 
You don’t work for us – you’re dead.

The Protagonist turns to Fay, confused.
FAY (CONT'D)
Your duty transcends national interests. This is about survival.

PROTAGONIST
Whose?
FAY
Everyone’s. There’s a cold war. Cold as ice. To even know its true nature is to lose.
(MORE)
 
FAY (CONT'D)
This is knowledge divided – all I have for you is a gesture –
(interlaces his fingers)
– in combination with a word – ‘tenet’. Use it carefully, it’ll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too.

PROTAGONIST
That’s all they’ve told you?
FAY
The test you passed? (beat)
Not everybody does.

Fay breaks eye contact with the Protagonist. The boat continues to nose into the swell.

EXT. LAUNCH, WIND FARM AT SEA – DUSK

The Protagonist is driven away from the boat on a launch, towards the GIANT WHITE TURBINES of the ocean wind farm.

The launch SLIPS amongst them, seeking the ladder of a particular one...

The Protagonist climbs the ladder to a door. He tries it – it’s open. He turns to see the launch move off into the gathering dark. The Protagonist ENTERS the wind turbine.

INT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS

In the bare space, the Protagonist finds a SPORTS BAG, a COT, a pallet of WATER and PROTEIN BARS. He opens the sports bag to find passports, cash, credit cards and a HI-VIZ VEST.

Under the vest is a small black cylinder. He unscrews the top to find three SILVER SUICIDE PILLS. The Protagonist shakes his head as he tosses them back into the bag.

INT. WIND TURBINE – LATER

The Protagonist EATS, DRINKS and EXERCISES by CLIMBING the endless interior ladder of the turbine. The stash of food and water SHRINKS...

The Protagonist does PULL-UPS at the very top of the ladder, FEET DANGLING over the VERTIGINOUS DROP...

INT. WIND TURBINE – MORNING

The Protagonist is woken by a repeated AIR HORN. He pulls himself off the cot, opens the door to find –
 

EXT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS

A large CATAMARAN nosed up to the windmill, ladder in place, MAINTENANCE CREW in HI-VIZ VESTS moving on and off the turbine. Other boats service other turbines. The Protagonist pulls on his VEST and CLIMBS down onto the catamaran.

EXT. EUROPEAN PORT – DAY

The Protagonist disembarks with the rest of the wind-farm crew. As they file past a car the driver, also in hi-viz, steps out into line, leaving the door open, engine running. The Protagonist gets in. The GPS is already set...

EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX – LATER

A bland suburban office park. The Protagonist gets out of the car, wearing his hi-viz and carrying a clipboard. Heads inside, passing numerous STAFF coming out...

INT. LOBBY, OFFICE COMPLEX – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist moves through the lobby unimpeded. Checking the tenant listings he sees – ‘WINDFARM TRANSITIONS – B-2’.

INT. CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist walks up to B-2.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
With a hi-viz vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere.
Almost.

The Protagonist turns to find a brusque young woman. This is BARBARA. He joins his hands, interlacing the fingers...

PROTAGONIST
A pretty obscure tenet.
Using a key card, she ushers him through a door into –

INT. OFFICE, LABORATORY – CONTINUOUS
Barbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea.
BARBARA
No small talk, nothing that might reveal who we are, or what we do.

PROTAGONIST
I thought I was here to find out what we do.
 

BARBARA
You’re not here for ‘what’, you’re here for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your department. And not my business.

PROTAGONIST
Well, to do what I do, I need some idea of the threat we face.

Barbara considers the Protagonist. Sips her tea.
BARBARA
As I understand it, we’re trying to prevent World War Three.

PROTAGONIST
Nuclear holocaust?
BARBARA
No. Something worse.

INT. SHOOTING RANGE – MOMENTS LATER

Barbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He reflexively checks the chamber and magazine – EMPTY.

BARBARA
Aim it and pull the trigger.

The Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a target 25m away with several holes in it...

He squeezes the trigger – BAM! – a shot. He is CONFUSED...
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Check the magazine.
The Protagonist checks the clip – THERE IS A ROUND IN IT.
PROTAGONIST
How?

Barbara pulls on PROTECTIVE GLOVES and removes the round from the clip, placing it next to an identical one on a table.

BARBARA
One of these bullets is, like us, travelling forwards through time. The other one’s going backwards. Can you tell which is which?
The Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward – BARBARA (CONT'D)
How about now? –
 

One of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVERSE.
The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round towards him so he can inspect it –

BARBARA (CONT'D)
It’s inverted – its entropy runs backwards. So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed. We think it’s a type of inverse radiation, triggered by nuclear fission.

PROTAGONIST
You didn’t make it?
BARBARA
We don’t know how. Yet.
PROTAGONIST
So where’d it come from?
BARBARA
Someone’s manufacturing them in the future. They’re streaming back at us.

Barbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAMERA.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Try it.
He puts on a glove – moves his hand over it, nothing.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
You have to have dropped it.

The Protagonist reaches out again – it LEAPS UP INTO HIS HAND.

PROTAGONIST
How can it move before I touch it?
She cues up the recording of what he just did – BARBARA
From your point of view you caught it, but from the bullet’s point of view...
She plays it BACKWARDS –
BARBARA (CONT'D)
...you dropped it.
ON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand.
PROTAGONIST
But cause has to come before effect.
 

BARBARA
No. That’s just how we see time.

She PULLS the round towards herself using one finger – the round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED...

PROTAGONIST
What about free will?
BARBARA
That bullet wouldn’t have moved if you hadn’t put your hand there.
Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.

She LAUNCHES it up into her other hand –
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Don’t try to understand it. Feel it.

Barbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE, BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER – the
Protagonist CATCHES IT...
PROTAGONIST
Instinct. Got it.

Barbara smiles, swaps him the round for the pistol. She then places a TRAY COVERED IN SHELL CASINGS beside him.

The Protagonist aims at the target – a shell casing LEAPS into the gun – he FIRES, and a bullet hole near the bullseye VANISHES –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Why does it feel so strange?
BARBARA
You’re not shooting the bullet, you’re catching it.

PROTAGONIST
Whoa.
The Protagonist examines the target – no bullet holes.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
I’ve seen this type of ammunition before.

BARBARA
In the field?
PROTAGONIST
I was almost hit.
 

BARBARA
Then you are exceedingly lucky...
The Protagonist turns to her...
BARBARA (CONT'D)
An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. The inverse radiation would spread through your body. Like polonium poisoning. Not pretty.

The Protagonist examines the rounds...
PROTAGONIST
These look like today’s.
BARBARA
They may have been made today, then inverted years from now.

PROTAGONIST
Where did you get them?
BARBARA
They came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I’m studying here.

PROTAGONIST
Do you have an analysis of the metals?

 

Sure. Why?
 
BARBARA

PROTAGONIST
 
The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made. Look, I know you said that ‘what’ is my business –

BARBARA
Let’s not go off-topic.
PROTAGONIST
I’m not seeing Armageddon here.
Barbara takes the round from him, and beckons him to follow –

INT. ARCHIVE – CONTINUOUS
Between tall sets of DRAWERS...
 

BARBARA
A bullet may not seem like much, but it’s a simple machine – lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If they can invert this – I see no reason they couldn’t invert pretty much anything. Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.

Barbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself –
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Now that we know what to look for, we’re finding more and more inverted material...

She opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AND PIECES – SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS...

BARBARA (CONT'D)
...remnants of complex objects.

The Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap into his hand.

PROTAGONIST
So what do you think we’re seeing?
BARBARA
The detritus of a coming war.
The Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS.

EXT. CROWDED STREET, MUMBAI – DAY

The Protagonist walks out of an electronics store, opening a new phone, and slips into the throng. He dials –

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
Yup?
PROTAGONIST
We live in a twilight world.
MALE VOICE
(over phone)
No friends at dusk. I was told you’d left the building.

PROTAGONIST
Even the dead need allies.
 

MALE VOICE
(over phone) Specifically?

PROTAGONIST
An assist in Mumbai. To get to Sanjay Singh.

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
Singh? He never leaves his house, and his house... well, it’s –

PROTAGONIST
Yes, it is – I’m looking right at it.

Above the bustling street, a HIGH-RISE HOUSE, at least twenty storeys tall, with two large balconies, towers over...

MALE VOICE
(over phone)
I’ll see who’s on deck. Bombay Yacht Club, two hours.

As the Protagonist hangs up, he spots a figure, on the top balcony. A WOMAN IN A SARI, standing high above the city.

INT. BOMBAY YACHT CLUB – EVENING

The Protagonist enters the quiet ex-colonial establishment. Takes a seat. A BUSINESSMAN sits down next to him.

BUSINESSMAN
It seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice. I’m Neil.

Neil offers his hand. The Protagonist takes it –
PROTAGONIST
I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

NEIL
Not possible.
PROTAGONIST
Ten minutes, tops.
NEIL
Time isn’t the problem. Getting out alive’s the problem.
(thinks)
Would you take a child hostage?
The Protagonist shakes his head.
 

 

A woman?
 
NEIL (CONT'D)

PROTAGONIST
 
If I had to. I’m not looking to make much noise here.

Neil keeps thinking. Signals a waiter –
NEIL
Vodka tonic.
(gestures at the Protagonist)
Diet Coke.
The Protagonist stares at Neil. Neil looks up, confused.
NEIL (CONT'D)
What? You never drink on the job.
PROTAGONIST
You’re well informed.
NEIL
It pays to be in our profession.
PROTAGONIST
Well, I prefer club soda.
NEIL
(grins) No, you don’t.

Neil raps his knuckles on the table, thinking.
NEIL (CONT'D)
How’s your parachuting?
PROTAGONIST
Broke an ankle in basic training. Singh’s house isn’t tall enough to parachute off of.

NEIL
(thinks)
But it’s bungee-jumpable.
PROTAGONIST
I don’t think ‘bungee-jumpable’ is a word.

NEIL
It may not be a word, but it may be your only way out of that place.
(a thought occurs)
Or into it, for that matter.
 

EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – EVENING
ARMED GUARDS patrol the balconies.

INT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Inside one of the magnificent rooms, a middle-aged Indian man mixes drinks. This is SANJAY SINGH.

EXT. LOW ROOFTOP NEXT DOOR TO HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Neil and the Protagonist race across the roof carrying a sports bag. Neil pulls out a WINCH, the Protagonist pulls out a large CATAPULT, loops it around two pipes, glancing down into the WALLED YARD at the foot of the high-rise house.

Neil BOLTS the winch to the roof, the Protagonist sights the upper balcony of the high-rise house, FIRES a ball with a line up and over the balcony railing...

EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Neil lie next to each other as the WINCH RUNS, TENSIONING THEIR ELASTIC LINES... they LAUNCH
themselves, FLYING UP to land against the side of the building –

They RUN SILENTLY UP THE BUILDING, onto the UPPER TERRACES,
SHOOTING TWO GUARDS with silenced pistols...

INT./EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Sanjay Singh hands a drink to the Woman in the sari. They move out onto the balcony –

EXT. BALCONY – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist surprises Sanjay, holds him at gunpoint –
PROTAGONIST
(to the Woman) Stay back.
(to Sanjay)
I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine. I want to know who supplied it.

SANJAY
My name’s Sanjay. And you are? (silence)
No chit-chat?
 

The Woman pushes a RED BUTTON on the wall –
PROTAGONIST
There’s no one at the other end. No one who’s going to help you, anyway.

INT. SECURITY STATION, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

An alarm buzzes, the Security Guards are frozen, Neil has a gun on them, a finger to his lips...

EXT. BALCONY, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS
Sanjay tries to turn to see the Protagonist –
SANJAY
Why would I know who supplied it?
The Protagonist pushes his head back around with the gun –
PROTAGONIST
The combination of metals is unique to India. If it’s from India, it’s from you.

SANJAY
A fair assumption –
PROTAGONIST
Deduction.
SANJAY
Deduction, then. Look, my friend, guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation.

PROTAGONIST
I’m not the man they send to negotiate...

He COCKS his weapon – puts the gun to Sanjay’s head –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
But I am the man people talk to.
SANJAY
(charm curdles)
I can’t. I can’t tell you.
PROTAGONIST
You’re an arms dealer, friend – this may be the easiest trigger I’ve ever had to pull.
 

WOMAN (O.S.)
To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by...

The Protagonist GLANCES at the Woman... whose fingers are casually INTERTWINED. The Protagonist brings his free hand up to hold the gun in both hands, fingers INTERLACED...

PROTAGONIST
If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me. Everything.

WOMAN
Not while you have a gun to my husband’s head.

The Protagonist releases him.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Sanjay, make us a drink.

INT. TERRACE OVERLOOKING MUMBAI, SANJAY’S HOUSE – LATER

Overlooking the extraordinary bustle of the city. Sanjay has left. His wife hands the Protagonist his drink –

PRIYA
I’m Priya Singh.
PROTAGONIST
This is your operation?
PRIYA
A masculine front in a man’s world has its uses. The dealer you’re looking for is Andrei Sator.

PROTAGONIST
The Russian oligarch?
PRIYA
You know him?
PROTAGONIST
Not personally. Made his billions in gas, moved to London and married an English girl. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

PRIYA
Very good. Except the ‘gas’ he made his billions from was actually plutonium, and he’s said to be on the outs so he can feed British Intelligence whatever the Russians want them to think they know.
 

PROTAGONIST
None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions.

PRIYA
When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary.

PROTAGONIST
So how did he get them inverted?
PRIYA
We believe he’s functioning as some kind of broker between our time and the future.

PROTAGONIST
He can communicate with the future?
PRIYA
We all do. Credit cards, email, text – anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future. The question is – can the future speak back? And, if so, what are they saying?

PROTAGONIST
And I’m supposed to find out?
PRIYA
To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist...

She reaches up to touch his cheek.
PRIYA (CONT'D)
Fresh as a daisy. Get close, find out what he’s receiving and how.

PROTAGONIST
Is it safe to involve British Intelligence?

PRIYA
I have a contact who’s out of Sator’s reach.

PROTAGONIST
One of us?
PRIYA
No, he thinks we’re chasing plutonium.

SIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arriving far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house...
 

PRIYA (CONT'D)
You’d better get out of here.
PROTAGONIST
Can’t you explain things?
PRIYA
You have to start looking at the world in a new way – this conflict runs backwards and forwards simultaneously. Your name on a police report reveals your identity to the future – they pass it back to Sator –

PROTAGONIST
My cover’s blown before I get near him.

PRIYA
You got in – you must’ve had a plan for getting out.

The Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness –
PROTAGONIST
Not one I loved.

Priya watches him clip onto the balcony rail. Neil FLIES PAST, dropping from the balcony above.

The Protagonist JUMPS, SLOWING as he DROPS BEHIND THE WALL, OUT OF REACH OF THE POLICE, into a MARKET STREET and RELEASES
his harness – disappearing into the crowd...

EXT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY
The Protagonist walks down the busy Mall, and up the steps...

INT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY
The Protagonist enters, is approached by a STEWARD.
STEWARD
Can I help you, sir?
PROTAGONIST
I’m Mr Crosby’s lunch.
STEWARD
I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby’s lunch?

PROTAGONIST
Presume away.
 

STEWARD
If you’ll follow me.

INT. LOUNGE, MEMBER’S CLUB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is shown to a table where a distinguished middle-aged man is already eating. CROSBY.

CROSBY
Started without you, hope you don’t mind.

PROTAGONIST
I’ll catch up.
(to the Steward) Same for me.

STEWARD
I’ll send the waiter.
PROTAGONIST
No, just pass on the order.
Crosby smiles at the Protagonist’s handling of the Steward.
CROSBY
I gather you’ve an interest in a certain Russian national.

PROTAGONIST
Anglo-Russian. So I’ll have to watch my step.

CROSBY
Indeed. He’s tapped into the intelligence services – I’ve warned them he’s feeding them rubbish, but they don’t seem to care.

PROTAGONIST
Tell me about him.
CROSBY
I assume you’re familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities?

PROTAGONIST
Closed cities, not shown on maps, built up around sensitive industries. Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns.

CROSBY
Not the one Sator grew up in. Stalsk-12. (MORE)
 
CROSBY (CONT'D)
In the seventies our people estimated its population at almost 200,000. Unacknowledged to this day. Thought to be abandoned.

PROTAGONIST
Abandoned?
CROSBY
Some kind of accident. After which we think it became a site for underground tests. Just two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev Opera siege, our satellites detected a detonation in north-west Siberia, about where we think Stalsk-12 was.

PROTAGONIST
Nuclear?
CROSBY
Big enough to be noticed. Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map with an ambition that eventually led him here, to buy his way into the British establishment.

PROTAGONIST
Through his wife?
CROSBY
Katherine Barton, eldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton. She works at Shipley’s, met Sator at an auction.

PROTAGONIST
He’s into art?
CROSBY
Like a lot of wealthy criminals, he thinks if he covers his walls with tasteful, expensive things it’ll distract from the bloodshed.
Judging by the lovely girl he married, there might be something in it.

PROTAGONIST
Happy marriage?
CROSBY
No. Practically estranged.
PROTAGONIST
How do I get to Sator?
CROSBY
Through her, of course.
 

PROTAGONIST
You may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction.

CROSBY
Hardly. We have an ace in the hole...

Crosby slides a SHOPPING BAG over to the Protagonist’s feet. The Protagonist looks inside: a small FRAMED DRAWING.

PROTAGONIST
You’re carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag?

CROSBY
It’s a fake, by a Spaniard named Arepo. One of two we confiscated from an embezzler in Bern. We hung on to this one for a rainy day – I felt the first drops when India called.

PROTAGONIST
What happened to the other one?
CROSBY
A Rubens. It turned up at Shipley’s, where it was authenticated by Katherine Barton before going under the hammer. And who do you suppose bought it?

PROTAGONIST
Her husband? Does she know it’s a forgery?

CROSBY
Hard to say. Rumour had it that she and Arepo were close.

Crosby looks the Protagonist over –
CROSBY (CONT'D)
Look, no offence, but this is a world where someone claiming to be a billionaire gets asked if they’re just a dollar billionaire.

PROTAGONIST
And?
CROSBY
Brooks Brothers won’t cut it.
PROTAGONIST
I’m assuming I have a budget.
 

CROSBY
(tosses him a credit card)
Save the world, then we’ll balance the books. Can I recommend a tailor?

PROTAGONIST
I’ll manage. You British don’t have a monopoly on snobbery, you know.

CROSBY
Not a monopoly. More of a controlling interest.

The Protagonist rises, taking the credit card and the bag.
PROTAGONIST
Thanks for this. By the way, is she a Kate or a Kathy?

CROSBY
A Kat, I believe.
The waiter arrives, bearing food, supervised by the Steward.
PROTAGONIST
Could you box that for me?
STEWARD
Certainly not.
The Protagonist smiles at Crosby, who nods goodbye.
PROTAGONIST
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

EXT. WEST LONDON PRIVATE SCHOOL – DAY

Mothers stand at the railings waiting for their kids. One of them, a smart YOUNG WOMAN, stands a little apart from the group. SCHOOLKIDS pile out of the school...

INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist watches from across the road as the Young Woman SPOTS her son. She offers him her hand, but he reaches up to take his NANNY’S. She moves her hand to pick something off his jumper before he is put into the back of a BLACK RANGE ROVER with tinted windows.

The Protagonist watches the Young Woman wave at the departing car carrying her child. Utterly alone.
 

EXT. SHIPLEY’S, LONDON – DAY

A BENTLEY pulls up – a DOORMAN opens the rear door, the Protagonist emerges, IMMACULATELY TAILORED, holding a beautiful leather briefcase.

INT. SHIPLEY’S – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist is approached by a REPRESENTATIVE –
REPRESENTATIVE
How can I help, sir?
PROTAGONIST
I have an appraisal with Ms Barton.
REPRESENTATIVE
(to receptionist)
Tell Kat her client is in the Fallow Room.

INT. APPRAISAL ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist admires the paintings on the walls. The door opens and the Young Woman from the school gates comes in, dressed for business. This is KAT BARTON. She looks bemused, but gives him a genuine and friendly smile –

KAT
I’m sorry, I wasn’t notified of any appointments, Mr...

PROTAGONIST
 
Goya?

Mr Goya?
 

KAT
 

The Protagonist opens his briefcase...
PROTAGONIST
No, I’m told you’re the person to see about...

Offers the drawing to her...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
...Goya.
She takes it, suddenly interested...
KAT
Wow. It’s extraordinary.
She lays the drawing on the table and grabs a loupe –
 

PROTAGONIST
What’s it worth?
KAT
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. There’s a lot of work before any kind of valuation – provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays...

She is bent over the table, peering through the loupe. The Protagonist studies her reaction as he –
PROTAGONIST
But what does your heart tell you?
She steps back. Something about the drawing BOTHERS her...
KAT
I’m sorry, where did you say you acquired this drawing?

PROTAGONIST
Tomas Arepo.
Kat rises and turns to face the Protagonist. Cold.
KAT
What do you want?
PROTAGONIST
What I want is complicated.
KAT
Do you work for my husband?
PROTAGONIST
I’ve never met your husband. That’s the reason I’m here. Is there somewhere we can talk?

KAT
In London? Not really.

INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT
The Protagonist and Kat sit at a corner table.
PROTAGONIST
I bought my Goya for cents on the dollar from an irate Swiss banker. Traced it to Arepo, and realized I’d scored a bargain when he told me who’d paid top dollar for another one of his pictures. Your husband.
 

KAT
Where’s the bargain? Your drawing’s an obvious fake.

PROTAGONIST
My drawing’s a very good fake – you know that better than anyone. The information’s the bargain.

KAT
The information that I helped defraud my own husband?

PROTAGONIST
He and I are in related businesses, but he’s a hard man to meet. If you and I were to make an arrangement –

KAT
Arrangement? You mean blackmail. Don’t be afraid of the word – my husband isn’t. And I’m sorry to tell you he got there first.

PROTAGONIST
He knows? And he’s never done anything about it?

KAT
Why would he?
PROTAGONIST
He paid nine million dollars –
KAT
Which would barely cover the holiday he just forced us on.

PROTAGONIST
Where’d you go – Mars?
KAT
Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht.
Kat looks the Protagonist up and down...
KAT (CONT'D)
You’ve got the suit. The shoes, the watch. But I think you’re a little out of your depth.

PROTAGONIST
(sharp)
People who’ve amassed fortunes like your husband’s aren’t generally okay with being cheated out of any of it.
 

Kat sips her wine. Wanting to talk. Knowing she shouldn’t.
KAT
The drawing is his hold over me. He threatened me with the police, prison, the works. He controls me, my contact with my son, everything. Leaving him would never have been easy, now it’s impossible. My life, now... You can’t fight. Just beg.
Or worse. In Viet Nam I tried to love him again. If there were still love, he might give me my son. We sat on that bloody boat and watched the sunsets, imitating an earlier time. He seemed happy, so I asked. And he made me an offer. To let me go if I agreed to never see my son again. I expressed myself –

INSERT CUT: a CRYSTAL BOWL of RASPBERRIES SMASHES onto the
polished wood of a yacht’s deck –
KAT (CONT'D)
Then took Max ashore. He called us, contrite. But when we came back...

INSERT CUT: Kat and Max on a launch – Kat follows Max’s gaze to see a FEMALE FIGURE SLIDE into the water...

KAT (CONT'D)
I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat. And he’d vanished.
I’ve never felt such envy.
PROTAGONIST
You don’t seem the jealous type.
KAT
Of her. You know how I dream of just diving off that boat? Of freedom?

PROTAGONIST
But you share a son.
KAT
And that’s my life.
PROTAGONIST
Did you know the drawing was a fake?

KAT
The authentication took months – Arepo and I became close, maybe too close. Maybe my judgement was clouded. I failed.
(MORE)
 
KAT (CONT'D)
But Andrei can’t conceive of failure, only betrayal. I didn’t betray my husband. In retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.

PROTAGONIST
And he let Arepo walk free?
KAT
If you’d actually met Arepo, as you claimed, you’d understand that he no longer walks anywhere.

PROTAGONIST
We spoke on the phone –
KAT
He can’t do that, either.
The Protagonist considers this.
PROTAGONIST
Where’s the drawing?
KAT
Why?
PROTAGONIST
Get me the introduction, I’ll take the drawing out of the equation. No picture, no prosecution. No hold over you.

Kat looks at the Protagonist. Not daring to hope.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
I might just be your second chance
–

KAT
(snaps)
I don’t need redemption.
PROTAGONIST
At betrayal.

A LARGE, WELL-DRESSED THUG sits down at the table. He takes a green bean from the Protagonist’s plate and chews it vacantly. This is VOLKOV. The Protagonist looks at Kat –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Friend of your husband? (she nods)
You knew this would happen?
 

KAT
They won’t kill you. Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.

PROTAGONIST
You must really not have liked the look of me.

KAT
(rising)
The look of you is fine. It’s better to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.

He takes her hand, pulls her forward to kiss her cheek.
PROTAGONIST
(whispers)
There’s a number in your left coat pocket. Don’t call from home.

A Thug puts a MEATY HAND on the Protagonist’s shoulder.
KAT
You won’t be taking my call.
PROTAGONIST
I might surprise you.

She leaves, BREEZING out through the kitchen... at Volkov’s nod, two Thugs escort the Protagonist from his chair, heading towards the kitchen – a WAITER moves to object – Volkov, eating the Protagonist’s leftovers, pulls the Waiter up short, shaking his head.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – MOMENTS LATER

Kat exits the restaurant, DISTRAUGHT, walking past a waiting THUG, then sliding into the back seat of a MERCEDES.

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS
The driver is a GAUNT RUSSIAN.
KAT
Please, let’s go.

The Gaunt Russian does not react, but watches through the rear-view mirror as a THUG enters the kitchen –

KAT (CONT'D)
Can we get going?
 

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters the kitchen, followed by the two thugs. CHEFS and BUSBOYS retreat as the other thug approaches...

INT./EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS
Kat turns from the window –
KAT
Please!
GAUNT RUSSIAN
He wants you to see...

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist JACKKNIFES HIS LOWER LEG UP into the crotch of the thug behind him – SPINS him into the Thug next to him
– POTS and Pans flying –

INT. RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

Volkov wipes sauce with bread, enjoying noises from the kitchen...

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Third Thug SWINGS – the Protagonist DODGES, takes the blow on the shoulder – SLAMS his head into the Third Thug’s neck, leaving him GASPING – the Protagonist GRABS the Third Thug, RACING for the WINDOW...

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

Kat FLINCHES as, with a CRASH of plates, a body TUMBLES down the stairs...

GAUNT RUSSIAN
And he gets what he wants.
Then she sees something else... the Protagonist exits.
KAT
Not always, apparently.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist brushes himself clean, SPOTS the Mercedes, starts moving towards it –
 

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

The Gaunt Russian SCRAMBLES to get the car moving. Kat looks back at the Protagonist as the car ROARS away...

EXT. SCHOOL GATES – DAY
Kat is crouched, talking to her son, MAX. The Nanny hovers –
MAX
Anna says we’re going to Pompeii and see lava.

KAT
We’ll go together. I’ll be there, too.

Max looks up at the Nanny. Kat hugs him, tight. The Nanny TAPS Kat on the shoulder. Kat smiles at her son, tears in her eyes, as the car pulls away. She pulls out her phone, dials... hears a RINGTONE behind her –

The Protagonist is there.
PROTAGONIST
I said I’d surprise you. He’s a cute kid.

KAT
Max. He’s everything.
PROTAGONIST
Where’s the drawing?
KAT
Oslo. At the airport.
PROTAGONIST
The airport?

INSERT CUT: a Rotas car drives across an airport apron, and down a ramp...

KAT
Do you know what a freeport is?
PROTAGONIST
A storage facility for art that’s been acquired –

...into a SLEEK facility – the OSLO FREEPORT – as a STAFF MEMBER stands ready to greet a new CLIENT...
 

KAT (V.O.)
But not yet taxed. We started a network – Rotas, his construction company, built them, I brought in clients. The facilities are tax havens...

The client is NEIL... he takes in the security arrangements...

PROTAGONIST (V.O.)
The clients can view their investments –

EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY

The Protagonist is standing on the roof of the Oslo Opera House, briefing Neil...

PROTAGONIST (V.O.)
– without importing them, so they avoid paying tax.

NEIL
Sort of a transit lounge for art?
We go back to Kat, on the street, briefing the Protagonist...
KAT
Art, antiques, anything of value, really.

 

Anything?
 
PROTAGONIST

KAT
 
Anything legal...
Then back to the Protagonist briefing Neil...
PROTAGONIST
But it’s not unlike the Swiss banking system. Opaque.

Back to Kat –

KAT
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport. I’m guessing it’s there.

PROTAGONIST
 
Guessing?
Back to Oslo –

Guessing?
 



NEIL
 

Back to Kat –
KAT
 











Kat nods.
 
We make trips there four or five times a year.

PROTAGONIST
To view art?
KAT
And whatever he does – it turns out art is of no importance to Andrei.

PROTAGONIST
But the freeports are.
 


INT. FREEPORT – DAY
A STAFF MEMBER brings Neil into a LUXURIOUS GALLERY – STAFF MEMBER
Some freeports are just warehouses
– here, you can actually enjoy your possessions...

Then through doors into an ANGLED INNER CORRIDOR...
STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D)
The structure of the vaults is based on The Pentagon – each vault a separate structure within the others. Damage to one structure won’t compromise the others.

They arrive at a door in the corridor. The Staff Member uses his thumb to unlock a door –

STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D)
Clients have biometric access straight in off the tarmac.

NEIL
From the terminal?
STAFF MEMBER
(confused)
From their private planes.
NEIL
Of course.
Neil checks the locks as the Staff Member opens the door into
–
 

INT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS
A VAST SHIPPING AREA filled with SHIPPING CONTAINERS – STAFF MEMBER
Our logistics department ships to and from other freeports without customs inspection...
Neil notices ROTAS containers marked for delivery to TALLINN.
NEIL (V.O.)
What’re you hoping to find?

EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY
PROTAGONIST
You really want to know?
NEIL
I’m not sure.
PROTAGONIST
Bring some lead-lined gloves.
NEIL
Jesus. Nuclear?
PROTAGONIST
When you’re on the tour –

INT. FREEPORT – DAY
Neil is shown back into one of the vaults...
PROTAGONIST (V.O.)
Pay attention to the fire precautions.

NEIL
Documents are vulnerable to –
STAFF MEMBER
Fire. Absolutely –
NEIL
I was going to say, water damage from sprinkler systems.

STAFF MEMBER
We don’t use sprinklers. (points to vents)
The facility is flooded with halide gas, displacing all the air within seconds.
 

NEIL
Can you show me?
STAFF MEMBER
If I did, we’d suffocate.
NEIL
What about the staff in here?
STAFF MEMBER
Halide only fills the vaults – they just have to get into the corridor. There’s a ten-second warning.

NEIL
You only give them ten seconds?
STAFF MEMBER
Our clients use us because we have no priorities above their property.

 

Blimey.
 
NEIL

STAFF MEMBER
 
Well, sir, you asked.

INT. OSLO AIRPORT – DAY
The Protagonist and Neil walk through the terminal.
NEIL
Vault doors are fireproof, hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers. Surprisingly easy, once there’s a lockdown.

PROTAGONIST
Why a lockdown?
NEIL
Power switches to fail-safe, sealing outer doors, but inner doors revert to factory settings and pickable locks. Child’s play, really.

PROTAGONIST
Child’s play? They’re inside airport security. They have to worry about climate control, not armed raids.

NEIL
So how do we get fire power through the perimeter to trigger a lockdown?
 

EXT. CROWDED AIRPORT BUS, OSLO AIRPORT – DAY

The Protagonist and Neil look across the tarmac to the freeport structure.

NEIL
Back wall of the freeport...
The Protagonist notices Neil start to smile...
PROTAGONIST
You’ve got something?
NEIL
You’re not going to like it.

EXT. OSLO STREET – DAY
The Protagonist looks at Neil in disbelief.
PROTAGONIST
You want to crash a plane?
NEIL
Not from the air, don’t be so dramatic. I want to run a jet off the taxiway, breach the rear wall, start a fire.

PROTAGONIST
How big a plane?
NEIL
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

They approach a MAN sitting on a harbour-front bench.
NEIL (CONT'D)
This is Mahir. His team will work the plane.

PROTAGONIST
There can’t be passengers –
MAHIR
Norskfreight. They use the hangar on the west side of the freeport.

PROTAGONIST
You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew?

MAHIR
We’ll pop the slides, chuck ’em off
–
 

PROTAGONIST
On the move?
MAHIR
What’s the problem? They’ll be fine.

PROTAGONIST
It seems... bold.
MAHIR
(smiles)
‘Bold’ I’m fine with – I thought you were going to say nuts.

PROTAGONIST
And if you get caught?
MAHIR
We won’t.

 

If you do?
 
PROTAGONIST

MAHIR
 
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one’s died. Swift extradition, then lost in the system. It’ll barely make the news.

NEIL
That may depend on the size of your explosion.

MAHIR
Actually, the gold bars might get some play.

 

Gold bars?
 
PROTAGONIST

NEIL
 
Norskfreight ships treasury gold once a month.

MAHIR
We blow the back, drop the gold out on the runway.

NEIL
No one’s going to be looking at your building, I guarantee you.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAY

Neil takes LUNGFULS of air, hyperventilating – Mahir starts a stopwatch. The Protagonist studies some plans...
 

PROTAGONIST
The space at the centre of the pentagon’s too big... there’s something there, not marked.

Neil runs out of air. Mahir checks his watch.
NEIL
A vault within a vault?
PROTAGONIST
Maybe.
MAHIR
Eighty-five seconds.
NEIL
Ample.
MAHIR
Won’t you be running? (turns to the Protagonist)
Start packing.
The Protagonist starts BREATHING HARD...

EXT. FREEPORT – NIGHT
The Protagonist and Neil, carrying BRIEFCASES, head inside.

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Two WORKERS (Mahir and his associate, ROHAN) back up a MEAL TRUCK to a TRANSPORT PLANE. They LIFT the cargo until it is level with the front side door...

INT. FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist follows Neil through security. Their briefcases are examined, finding FRAMED DOCUMENTS...

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Mahir and Rohan carry crew meals through the door and into the galley, where they stack them into the catering units, supervised by a GUARD...

INT. GALLERY SPACE/LOUNGE, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member brings Neil an espresso. The Protagonist subtly checks his watch...
 

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS
Mahir points past the Guard –
MAHIR
You gonna eat that?

The Guard turns – Mahir GRABS him from behind, Rohan stuffs a COTTON PAD over the Guard’s face, rendering him unconscious. They ROLL him into the catering-truck lift... Mahir pops out and signals ANOTHER GUARD...

THREE GUARDS have been dumped into the truck lift – Rohan sends it DOWN, SEALS the plane door. Mahir approaches the cockpit as the PILOTS perform checks – SHOWS THEM HIS GUN...

MAHIR (CONT'D)
Alright, lads?

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member leads Neil and the Protagonist into the vaults...

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

At gunpoint, the Pilots nervously pull back from the hangar. Rohan checks the stacks of GOLD BARS secured in the rear.

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

The plane is TOWED back onto the taxiway and lifts its engines, easing forward...

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan SLASHES the restraining straps – CROUCHES behind the pile of gold – pulls out a GRENADE – GRABS the nearest gold bar and STUFFS it into his waistband before PULLING THE PIN...

INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member shows Neil and the Protagonist into a vault. Neil puts down his briefcase – pulls out the framed documents.

EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS
The transport plane BARRELS down the taxiway...
 

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan TOSSES the grenade behind the gold at the tail of the plane and DUCKS as it BLOWS –

EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

BLASTING a hole in the rear of the plane... GOLD BARS POUR OUT, CLATTERING ACROSS THE TARMAC...

INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Hearing the distant explosion, the Protagonist and Neil start PACKING AIR... the Staff Member stares at them, quizzical –

NEIL
(between breaths)
Yoga.

INT. COCKPIT, TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS
Mahir forces the Pilots from their seats –

EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

The INFLATABLE SLIDE BURSTS OPEN, DRAGGING on the asphalt, as the Pilots roll onto it, SCRAMBLING DOWN to the ground, ROLLING AWAY from the giant plane...

INT. COCKPIT, TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Mahir TURNS the stick HARD LEFT, AIMING AT THE REAR WALL OF THE FREEPORT –

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan lowers a ladder behind the forward landing gear – he and Mahir climb down –

EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Mahir and Rohan jump down onto the asphalt, racing back between the wheels as the giant plane SMASHES INTO THE BRICK WALL OF THE FREEPORT, ERUPTING IN A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...

INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The vault is ROCKED by the explosion – ALARMS SCREAM – DOORS START CLOSING – Neil looks, panicked, at the Staff Member –
 

NEIL
Ten seconds, right?!

The Staff Member BOLTS – PUSHING PAST THEM – they take a last gulp of air – GAS HISSES IN. They pull apart the frames of the documents, BREAKING THEM INTO LOCK-PICKING APPARATUS –
lockpicks, small crowbar – they go to work on the INNER DOOR, PRYING open a panel – HOT-WIRING it – the door SLIDES UP –

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

They BURST into the corridor, GASPING – the door SLAMS DOWN behind them – they HUSTLE down to the next vault door – get to work. The door opens, they GULP AIR, then RACE inside –

INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

– round the corner past RACKS, CRATES, some BROKEN – stop at the next door, the Protagonist picks the lock – his PICK BREAKS – Neil BOLTS back to where they entered – the Protagonist STRUGGLES, pulling out pieces of the pick – Neil gets to the first door –

NO HANDLE – the Protagonist uses a different tool – Neil SMASHES the door, full-blown PANIC – he looks to the end of the vault where the ROLLER DOOR is BROKEN at the bottom, halide gas HISSING OUT –

Neil races towards it – the Protagonist gets his door OPEN – Neil STUMBLES past – the Protagonist DRAGS him through the door –

INT. INNER CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS
They lie GASPING. Neil hears something, looks around –
NEIL
(urgent whisper)
There’s someone in here with us!
The Protagonist is up, moving down the corridor...

They arrive at two doors, side by side: the Rotas vault. They each work on a door. Neil’s OPENS –

NEIL (CONT'D)
Need a hand?
The Protagonist works his door... nothing.
PROTAGONIST
Actually, yes.
Neil leans over, hits ‘ENTER’, the door OPENS.
 

INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters a room, one side of which is a LONG GLASS WINDOW. Neil is on the other side of the glass, in an IDENTICAL ROOM. There are BULLET HOLES in the glass. At the end of each room is a tube, like a sealed in REVOLVING DOOR. The Protagonist’s feet crunch BROKEN GLASS...

Neil examines BULLET HOLES in the wall opposite the glass. WISPS of SMOKE gather near the holes – Neil reaches up –

PROTAGONIST
Don’t touch them –
NEIL
What the hell happened here?

The Protagonist sees a STRIPPED AUTOMATIC PISTOL on the floor. He picks it up, thinking –

PROTAGONIST
It hasn’t happened, yet.

Neil looks at the Protagonist, quizzical – A LOUD HUM STARTS UP from the revolving door... the Protagonist looks down – MOVEMENT beneath his feet – the DEBRIS – SMOKE GATHERS – the revolving doors ROTATE, OPENING – a BLACK-CLAD FIGURE in a GAS MASK LEAPS BACKWARDS from the tube – reaching behind itself to GRAB the stripped automatic in the Protagonist’s hand –

On Neil’s side an identical BLACK-CLAD FIGURE LEAPS out FORWARDS – knocks Neil over, moving for the vault door –

A SLIDE jumps into the Backwards Figure’s hand – he REASSEMBLES the gun in the Protagonist’s hand – a MAGAZINE jumping up to LOAD IT – BLAM!

A bullet is SUCKED OUT OF THE WALL – THROUGH THE GLASS –
‘HEALING’ THE BULLET HOLES – the Protagonist STRUGGLES with the Backwards Figure – whose REVERSE MOVEMENTS seem ALIEN and IMPOSSIBLE –

Neil gives chase – RACING out of the vault door –

The Backwards Figure pulls the Protagonist sideways, lining up his head with the next bullet hole – BLAM! GLASS FLIES UP as the shot JUST MISSES the Protagonist’s head –

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
Neil CHASES the Forwards Figure down the corridor –
 

INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist STRUGGLES – the Backwards Figure PUSHES him towards the next bullet hole, STRANGE REVERSE GROANING building in its throat, behind the black gas mask, the GROAN PEAKING AS the Protagonist takes his PICK and STABS the Backwards Figure in the arm and SMACKS the Figure’s gun out of its hand – it BOUNCES out the door –

The Figure RISES into the Protagonist’s arms – PULLS him backwards – we can’t tell if it’s PUSHING or the Protagonist is PULLING as they move backwards through the door –

INT. CORRIDOR, VAULT – CONTINUOUS
The Figure PUSHES/PULLS the Protagonist down the corridor –

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Neil RACES around a corner, GRABS the Figure’s MASK, which COMES OFF – he looks, SURPRISED, at the Figure’s face, WHICH WE CANNOT SEE, then TURNS, RACING back the way he came...

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist and the Backwards Figure struggle into –

INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

They SMASH into the racks and crates – the Protagonist GRABS the gun – raises it to the Figure’s head –

NEIL (O.S.)
NO! Don’t kill him!
The Protagonist freezes – Neil steps up, DESPERATE –
NEIL (CONT'D)
We need to know if you’re compromised.

The Protagonist THROWS the Figure to the ground –
PROTAGONIST
Why are you here?!

The Protagonist tries to rip off the gas mask, but it is strapped tight – the REVERSE KEENING gets LOUDER and LOUDER. The Protagonist STEPS onto the Figure’s injured arm...

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Who sent you?!
 

The Figure’s reverse screaming gets louder – the Protagonist KICKS its arm, HARD, AGAIN AND AGAIN –

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) HOW DID YOU KNOW WE’D BE HERE!

A BOOM! from outside – AIR starts BLOWING ACROSS the Backwards Figure, SUCKING underneath the broken roller door – the Backwards Figure SLIDES impossibly across the floor and underneath the door which SLAMS shut, unbroken behind him.

The Protagonist and Neil look at each other...
NEIL
We have to go.

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

One of the plane’s JET ENGINES has come loose, STILL THRUSTING, SWINGING AROUND, wreaking HAVOC for the EMERGENCY SERVICES – an AMBULANCE SKIDS SIDEWAYS, avoiding the THRUST...

Mahir and Rohan stand at a distance, watching the MAYHEM along with DOZENS of other UNIFORMED AIRPORT WORKERS...

INT./EXT. FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
EMTS race in past the Staff Member...

INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
Neil moves to the other door – works the lock – SIRENS sound
–

PROTAGONIST
What happened to the other guy?
NEIL
I took care of him.
The door opens – they slip into the outer vault –

INT. OUTER VAULT, FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER

They reassemble the document frames, then LIE DOWN, ‘unconscious’ – EMERGENCY SERVICES BURSTS IN...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAWN
Neil hangs up his phone –
 

NEIL
Mahir and Rohan slipped out clean. (turns to the
Protagonist)
I’ve seen too much and I’m still alive. Which means you’ve decided to trust me.

PROTAGONIST
Or I’ve lost my edge.
NEIL
Oh, your edge is intact.
The Protagonist looks at Neil.
PROTAGONIST
There’s a cold war.
NEIL
 
Nuclear?

Temporal.
 
PROTAGONIST NEIL
 
(skeptical) Time travel?
PROTAGONIST
No. Technology that can invert an object’s entropy.

NEIL
You mean reverse chronology. Like Feynman and Wheeler’s notion that a positron is an electron moving backwards in time.

PROTAGONIST
Sure, that’s exactly what I meant.
NEIL
I’ve a master’s in physics.
PROTAGONIST
Well, try to keep up.
NEIL
The implications of this are –
PROTAGONIST
Beyond secret.
NEIL
Then why’d you take me in?
 

PROTAGONIST
I thought we’d find the drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.

NEIL
You were as surprised as I was.
PROTAGONIST
I’m going back to Mumbai for answers. I’ll set you up as go- between. But remember – to you, all this is about plutonium. Or when we’re done, they’ll kill you.

NEIL
Won’t you have to anyway?
PROTAGONIST
I’d rather it was my decision.
NEIL
So would I. I think.

INT./EXT. FERRY BOAT, MUMBAI – DAY
The Protagonist boards, approaching Priya at the rail.
PRIYA
I don’t like to leave my house.
PROTAGONIST
And I don’t like bungee jumping. But we need to talk.

PRIYA
What about?
PROTAGONIST
Inversion.
PRIYA
We spoke about it –
PROTAGONIST
I don’t remember anything about people being inverted –

PRIYA
We’re trying to do with inversion what we couldn’t do with the atomic bomb – uninvent it. Divide and contain the knowledge. Ignorance is our ammunition – the more any one of us knows, the greater the risk that we’re actually making the situation worse.
 

PROTAGONIST
Risk more.

Priya gestures at the paper. A headline: ‘OSLO GOLD FREIGHT CRASH – TERRORISM? ROBBERY? BOTH?’

PRIYA
Your work?
The Protagonist nods.
PRIYA (CONT'D)
What did you find in the vaults?
PROTAGONIST
Two antagonists, one inverted. We took out the regular one, the inverted one got away.

PRIYA
Both emerged at the same moment?
PROTAGONIST
Yeah.
PRIYA
They were the same person. You saw someone re-inverting. Sator’s built a turnstile in that vault.

PROTAGONIST
Turnstile?
PRIYA
A machine for inverting.
PROTAGONIST
You told me the technology hasn’t been invented, yet.

PRIYA
It hasn’t. He’s been given it by the future.

PROTAGONIST
For what?
PRIYA
You’ve the best chance of finding out.

EXT. MUMBAI STREET – MOMENTS LATER
They walk, BODYGUARDS at a discreet distance.
PRIYA
Have you met him?
 

PROTAGONIST
I was close.
PRIYA
Get closer.
PROTAGONIST
I’ve been compromised. Unless that antagonist was a coincidence.

PRIYA
The wife set you up?
PROTAGONIST
Maybe. There’s a good chance I get killed as soon as I go back in.

PRIYA
This was always a suicide mission – that’s why they recruited a corpse.

PROTAGONIST
Who did? Who are we working for?
PRIYA
Everyone. Survival. You need more, consider yourself working for me.

PROTAGONIST
Well, Boss, I need a way to succeed.

Priya thinks. Looks at the Protagonist. Deciding.
PRIYA
What if you have something he needs?

 

Such as?
 
PROTAGONIST

PRIYA
 
Plutonium 241. Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev. He got the team, but not the 241.

PROTAGONIST
Who did?
PRIYA
Ukrainian security services. It’s moving through Tallinn in a week.
 

PROTAGONIST
Helping an arms dealer steal weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable. I’m just gonna take him out.

PRIYA
No. Sator has to stay alive until we know his part in things.
Leverage the situation without losing control of the 241.

PROTAGONIST
It’s too dangerous.
PRIYA
A terrorist bomb, even one that kills millions, is nothing compared with what happens if we don’t stop Sator.

PROTAGONIST
From. Doing. What?
Priya looks up the road at the cars STREAMING past...
PRIYA
We’re being attacked. Not by terrorists or rogue states...

PROTAGONIST
Who, then?
PRIYA
We’re being attacked by the future. And we’re fighting over time.

PROTAGONIST
Time?
PRIYA
Theirs is running out, so they’re coming for ours. And Sator is helping. You have to find out how.

EXT. TERRACE, AMALFI COAST – DAY

The Protagonist leaves the tourists behind, heading down a leafy path to emerge at a terrace overlooking the sea. Kat stands there, alone. The Protagonist falls in beside her.

KAT
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing?
 

PROTAGONIST
You don’t have to worry about it any more.

KAT
You destroyed it?
PROTAGONIST
I didn’t think you’d want it back.
KAT
Does he know?
PROTAGONIST
Not yet, so sit tight.
KAT
Sit tight? Why? Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.

PROTAGONIST
It won’t be long. In the meantime, introduce me.

KAT
As what?
PROTAGONIST
I’m a former First Secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh, we met at a party last June –

KAT
We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don’t think it was June –

PROTAGONIST
June 29th. 7 for 7:30, salmon on the printed menu swapped for sea bass on the night. Sator left early, that’s when we met. Don’t offer any of this, it’s there if he asks. I came into Shipley’s in London, you ran into me here and want to show me the yacht.

KAT
He’ll think we’re having an affair.
PROTAGONIST
And he’ll want to meet me.
KAT
Or have you killed.
PROTAGONIST
Let me worry about that.
 

KAT
Did I look worried?

EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – DAY
The Protagonist and Kat look out at an enormous yacht.
KAT
Sleeps 70, with crew. Four tenders, two helicopters, missile defences –

PROTAGONIST
Jesus. Worried about pirates?
KAT
Andrei loves playing one government off another. The day they turn, that’s his refuge.

PROTAGONIST
What if I joined you?
She nods at Volkov, holding the launch’s line.
KAT
I’m not sure Volkov’s taking passengers just now.

PROTAGONIST
Then let’s take mine.
The Protagonist nods at Volkov as they walk past.

EXT. HARBOUR, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist GUNS his boat hard, carving a GLITTERING PATH across the calm harbour. Kat sits, enjoying the speed.

The Protagonist pulls up alongside the yacht, CREW MEMBERS SCRAMBLE, unaccustomed to unauthorized approaches. The Protagonist follows Kat’s gaze to a FIGURE above, but the sun is behind it. Kat steps onto the yacht.

The Protagonist gives the figure a JAUNTY SALUTE. No response. The Protagonist ZIPS back towards shore, passing the yacht’s launch. He waves at Volkov.

INT./EXT. YACHT – MOMENTS LATER
Follow Kat into the enormous lounge. She drops her bags – MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Who’s the American?
 

She turns. A middle-aged man with cold eyes and a thin beard stands in the doorway. THIS IS SATOR.

KAT
A friend.
SATOR
The man from Shipley’s?
KAT
Who you tried to have beaten up?
SATOR
I ask again. Who is he?
KAT
We met in Riyadh. In June at the American Embassy.

SATOR
Good with fists for a diplomat...
KAT
Paranoia’s your department. He seems nice, I invited him to the dinner.
(turns away) Max?... Max?!...

SATOR
He’s visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

KAT
Overnight? You just sent him off?!
SATOR
He’s my son.
KAT
Our son. I told him I’d go with him
–

SATOR
I explained you were busy. With your friend.

He turns, walks away. She watches him leave.

INT. RESTAURANT, AMALFI COAST – EVENING

The Protagonist walks towards a table where Sator, holding court, attacks some crabs. Volkov stops the Protagonist and FRISKS him, in full view of the diners.
 

PROTAGONIST
Where I’m from, you buy me dinner first.

Without looking, Sator gestures at a seat, Volkov lets the Protagonist pass. He sits.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Mr Sator? I’m –
SATOR
(quiet)
Don’t bother. Just tell me if you’ve slept with my wife, yet.

The Protagonist glances up at Kat, opposite, chatting.
PROTAGONIST
No. Not yet.
A glance from Sator between buttery mouthfuls of crab.
SATOR
How would you like to die?
PROTAGONIST
Old.
SATOR
You chose the wrong profession.

Sator returns a toast from a grinning guest. Reaches a greasy palm to the Protagonist’s cheek, as if in friendliness...

SATOR (CONT'D)
There’s a walled garden up the road. We’re going to take you there, cut your throat, not across, in the middle, like a hole. Then we take your balls, stuff them in the cut, block the windpipe.

PROTAGONIST
Complex.
SATOR
It’s gratifying to watch a man you don’t like try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes.

PROTAGONIST
Is this how you treat all your guests?

SATOR
The ones using my family to get to me.
 

PROTAGONIST
How else is someone supposed to get to you?

SATOR
Only a fool wants to be near me.
PROTAGONIST
Or someone who has something worth delaying your gratification for...

Sator signals Volkov – Kat glances over as Volkov RISES –
SATOR
We’re finished.
PROTAGONIST
Do you like opera?
At this, Sator pauses. Waves off Volkov.
SATOR
Not here. You sail?
PROTAGONIST
I’ve messed around on boats.
SATOR
Be on the dock at eight. Ready to do more than mess around.

Kat, relieved, watches the Protagonist leave.

EXT. DINING ROOM, YACHT – MORNING

Kat enters, dressed in sailing gear. Sator is already seated, similarly dressed, reading his phone, with a cup of coffee.

KAT
Max has missed too much school this year. I’m taking him back to England.

SATOR
No, you’re not. He has a tutor here.

KAT
The school won’t be okay with –
SATOR
Yes, they will.
KAT
Can I finish?!
 

SATOR
Look around you – he has everything he needs here.

A SERVANT places a plate with a silver cover in front of Kat, then pours her coffee.

KAT
You don’t care what he needs. You bought the trappings of a king, but we both know you’re a grubby little man playing power games with a wife who doesn’t love him any more.

Sator looks at her.

SATOR
You seem spirited today.
KAT
(defiant)
Do I?
Sator barely nods at the servant, who pulls off the lid...
SATOR
Yes. You do.

On the plate, instead of breakfast, is a small drawing. A ‘Rubens’. Kat freezes.

SATOR (CONT'D)
Were you worried it had been destroyed? Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault. I’ve always had instincts about the future. That’s how I built this life you no longer value.

Kat looks up at him, not knowing what to say or do.

EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – MORNING

The Protagonist stands on the dock, dressed for sailing, watching the launch approach...

PROTAGONIST
Morning.
As he gets on, Kat ignores him. Sator enjoys this.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist tries to catch Kat’s eye, but she will not look his way.
 

Sator hands the Protagonist a HARNESS and a HELMET... he looks at them, taken aback, then looks ahead – towards TWO GRAPHITE DARK, HIGHEST TECH AMERICA’S CUP SAILING YACHTS,
trimmed and ready.

PROTAGONIST
(impressed)
When you said sailing...

EXT. SAILING YACHT DECK – MOMENTS LATER

Kat gets on, followed by Sator and the Protagonist. The rigging crew departs. Kat checks the sheets and winches. Sator indicates the harness.

SATOR
You know how?
PROTAGONIST
Aye, Captain.
Sator gestures at Kat.
SATOR
She’s captain.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – LATER
The boats FLY, SKIMMING THE WATER ON THEIR HYDROFOILS...
Sator and the Protagonist are next to each other, standing on one pontoon, LEANING OUT IN THEIR HARNESSES... Kat is at the wheel, concentrating...

SATOR
What do you know about opera?
PROTAGONIST
In 2008 a remote Russian missile station was overwhelmed and held for a week. When the station was retaken, the plutonium 241 on one warhead was three quarters of a kilo lighter. The missing 241 surfaced at the opera-house siege in Kiev on the 14th.

SATOR
You’re well informed. But that doesn’t mean you have the plutonium.

PROTAGONIST
I didn’t say I had it. I’m saying I know how to get it –
 

KAT (O.S.) COMING ABOUT!

Kat SWINGS the boat into the wind, SAIL FLAPPING FURIOUSLY as the wind catches it on the other side, and Sator and the Protagonist DUCK under the boom, RACING to the other side, their harnesses SNAPPING TAUT as they lean out...

SATOR
What do you propose?
PROTAGONIST
Partnership.
SATOR
I wouldn’t partner with you.

Kat works the wheel, tracking the other boat. Her look is one of BOTTLED RAGE...

PROTAGONIST
What’s wrong with me?
SATOR
You know how to handle yourself, you have no record.

PROTAGONIST
Someone in the arms trade with training who covers his tracks? Not that shocking.

SATOR
For an intelligence agent.
Sator holds the Protagonist’s gaze...
KAT
Secure your jib line.
The Protagonist turns – Kat leans in to Sator –
KAT (CONT'D)
Burn in hell, Andrei –

– and YANKS HIS QUICK-RELEASE – he FLIES off the boat, SMASHING HEAD-FIRST into the waves –

The Protagonist sees Sator FACE-DOWN, UNCONSCIOUS – he UNCLIPS, JUMPS to the wheel, SPINNING the boat OFF THE WIND –

KAT (CONT'D)
YOU CAN’T JIBE A BOAT LIKE THIS – !

The Protagonist STEERS the boat across the wind, SNAPPING THE BOOM ACROSS, ALMOST LOSING THE MAST –
 

PROTAGONIST
You can if you have to –
He RELEASES THE SHEETS, SPILLING WIND, LOSING SPEED – as they
pass Sator he DIVES into the water – GRABS the oligarch – PULLS his face out of the water... Sator starts COUGHING...

INT. STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – DAY

The Protagonist dries himself – the door opens – Kat BURSTS in –

KAT
WHY DIDN’T YOU LET HIM DROWN?!
She is on him, smashing her fists into his chest –
PROTAGONIST
I need him.
KAT
To sell guns?!
PROTAGONIST
I’m not who you think I am.
KAT
That, I know – he showed me the drawing.

 

I’m sorry.
 
PROTAGONIST

KAT
 
Do you have any idea what you’ve done?

PROTAGONIST
I had to get close to him. I don’t know what you think your husband is
–

KAT
We both know he’s an arms dealer.
PROTAGONIST
He’s so much more.
KAT
What, then?
PROTAGONIST
Andrei Sator holds all our lives in his hands. Not just yours.

She looks bemused. A KNOCK at the door – she hides behind it
–
 

VOLKOV
Mr Sator wants to see you.
The Protagonist nods – pushes the door – Volkov stops it –
VOLKOV (CONT'D)
Now.
PROTAGONIST
He wants to see me without pants?
Volkov lets the door shut. The Protagonist turns to Kat –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Trust me.
KAT
Save it. I’m not falling for it twice.

The Protagonist looks at Kat. Sighs.
PROTAGONIST
You have a better option?
She looks into the Protagonist’s eyes. Assessing.
KAT
Whatever it takes to get what you want. Just like him. Not a second’s thought about me. My son. What do you think he’s going to do to me now?

He pulls a gun from his bag. Offers it to her.
PROTAGONIST
Try not to use this –
She takes it – lets it point at him.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
On anyone.

INT. STUDY, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING

The Protagonist is shown in. Sator is sitting behind his desk. A DOCTOR is taking his blood pressure.

SATOR
Enough –

Sator RIPS the cuff off his arm, sending the doctor out – checks a fitness tracker on his wrist.
 

SATOR (CONT'D)
See? Pulse of a man half my age. Drink with me.

Sator pours them both tumblers of vodka.
SATOR (CONT'D)
It seems I now owe you my life.
PROTAGONIST
It’s nothing.
Sator fixes his black gaze on the Protagonist.
SATOR
My life is not nothing. And I don’t like to be in debt.

PROTAGONIST
Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.

A dangerous beat. Then Sator GRINS –
SATOR
You think she released my harness? (laughs)
It was my own mistake.
PROTAGONIST
Then help me steal the 241. I need resources. It’s weapons-grade plutonium – that means special handling, containment facilities –

SATOR
I know what it means. You lecture me about radiation. Andrei Sator, digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager?

PROTAGONIST
Where?
SATOR
Stalsk-12. My home.
Sator sips his drink. Looks the Protagonist in the eye.
SATOR (CONT'D)
One pod of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others. They needed people to find the plutonium...
 

INSERT CUT: IN A DESOLATE STREET, SNOW FALLS ON A HAZMAT- SUITED SCAVENGER – A YOUNG SATOR WALKING IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE MINING MACHINE, CARRYING A GIANT CROWBAR AND A GEIGER COUNTER...

SATOR (CONT'D)
It became my first contract – nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.

INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR SPOTS THE MACHINE UNEARTHING A LARGE METAL CAPSULE. A FELLOW WORKER SEES THE SAME THING...

SATOR (CONT'D)
But one man’s probability of death is another man’s possibility for a life...

INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR OPENS THE CAPSULE. HE LIFTS OUT SOME PAPERS, WHICH HAVE HIS NAME ON THEM, REVEALING GOLD BARS UNDERNEATH. THE FELLOW WORKER LEANS IN, STUDYING THE GOLD. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT... SATOR STRIKES THE FELLOW WORKER WITH HIS CROWBAR, KILLING HIM...

SATOR (CONT'D)
I staked my claim in the new Russia. Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.

PROTAGONIST
The 241’s being transported through Northern Europe on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot at Trieste. I’m told you have resources in Tallinn.

Sator downs his vodka.
SATOR
Stay with us tonight. I insist.

INT. KAT’S STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – NIGHT

Kat slips the gun under her mattress, feels the lump – pulls it out – moves to the desk, puts it in her jewellery case – hearing a noise she jumps onto the bed, picks up a book. The door opens. Sator. He locks the door.

KAT
What do you want, Andrei?
SATOR
We’re going to talk about today.
KAT
No, we’re not.
 

He removes a DIAMOND CUFFLINK...
SATOR
No?
Kat starts to get off the bed –
KAT
Don’t think for a minute you can treat me the way you treat your other women.

Sator shifts to lean on the desk, cutting her off from the jewellery box. She sits back down. He removes his belt...

SATOR
And how do you imagine I treat these other women?

Sator slips the cufflink through a belt hole...
SATOR (CONT'D)
You think I force them into conversation?

Sator tests the diamond studded belt against his palm.
SATOR (CONT'D)
You want to be quiet? Fine...
He tosses her a pillow.
SATOR (CONT'D)
Bite down on that...

Sator moves towards her – she looks at the jewellery box on the desk – no way around him – Sator looks down at her. She looks up at his cold eyes...

KAT
Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response. Is fear and pain enough? Because that’s all I have to offer.

SATOR
Then it’ll have to do.
KAT
Why didn’t you just throw me out?
SATOR
If I can’t have you, no one can.
KAT
At what point do you give up and kill me?
 

Sator shrugs, wraps the belt a turn around his fist...
SATOR
Turn over.
KAT
Touch me, I scream so loud he hears.

SATOR
You think I’d let him interfere?
KAT
If he tried you’d have to kill him. End of deal. So leave me the fuck alone.

A KNOCK at the door.

SATOR
NOT NOW!

But he hears a RUMBLING... Sator, without a word, exits –

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – NIGHT
Sator GRABS binoculars from one of his men, peering out – A helicopter EMERGES from the darkness, THUNDERING IN...

INT. GUEST STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist listens to the incoming chopper – pulls on a black Windbreaker – quietly opens his door...

INT. PASSAGE, BELOW DECKS, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist makes his way, looking for an exit...

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – CONTINUOUS

The chopper descends to the landing pad – rotors turning as Sator signals his men to head in...

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist is on a roof overlooking the helipad...

He watches Sator’s men remove a LARGE, GRUBBY CAPSULE and take it below as the chopper LIFTS OFF...
 

INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist makes his way through the storage area. Peering through a window, he sees –

INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Crew gathered around the capsule. Sator enters, wipes dirt from the latches and opens it. Sator puts his hand over the open capsule, letting small, flat GOLD BARS leap from the capsule into his hand... he looks up, expectantly...

The Crew SHOVES a CREW MEMBER forwards, onto his knees... eyes downcast, he reaches behind – pulls a gold bar from his rear pocket. He offers it to Sator with TREMBLING hands.

Sator takes it, eyes never leaving the Crew Member... who finally, tentatively looks up –

BAM! Sator JABS him in the mouth with the gold bar, then SMASHES him over the head –

INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist is REPULSED by what he sees...

INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Sator steps back, breathless, from the Small Crew Member, who lies motionless on the ground.

As Sator raises his wrist to check his fitness tracker, BLOOD drips from the gold bar in his hand.

SATOR
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.

EXT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist SENSES, TURNS – CRACK! Volkov smashes his jaw
– KICKS him in the ribs – pistol-whips him...

INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – MOMENTS LATER
The Protagonist, bleeding, is SHOVED into the room –
VOLKOV
He was at the window.
Sator looks at the Protagonist, who nods at the capsule –
 

PROTAGONIST
I was curious.
SATOR
My property shouldn’t concern you. Who are you? How do you come by your information about the opera?

PROTAGONIST
Do I work for intelligence services? Several, just like you. You wouldn’t do business with someone who wasn’t savvy enough to be recruited. Hell, the CIA provides two-thirds of the market for fissile material.

SATOR
They’re usually buying, not selling. But we do live in a twilight world...

PROTAGONIST
Is that Whitman? It’s pretty.
SATOR
Next warning’s a bullet in your brain.

PROTAGONIST
No balls in my throat?
SATOR
There’ll be no time for such things in Tallinn.

Sator gestures to his men – they lift the capsule. The Protagonist spots DRIED MUD from the latches on the table...

SATOR (CONT'D)
Make your way there. I want Volkov on the team.

The Protagonist struggles to his feet.
PROTAGONIST
No. I spring the materials, you pay me off. Your wife does the exchange.

SATOR
I never involve her in my business.
PROTAGONIST
That’s why I trust her.
 

SATOR
(to Volkov) Put him ashore.

PROTAGONIST
How do I contact you?
SATOR
You don’t.
PROTAGONIST
How do you advance me funds?

Sator TOSSES the Protagonist the BLOODY GOLD BAR – the Protagonist FUMBLES it onto the table. Volkov SNEERS –

SATOR
Handle the plutonium better than that.

The Protagonist, looking Volkov in the eye, picks up the gold bar, scooping DRIED MUD into his hand, unseen.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS, TALLINN – DAY
The Protagonist walks the crowded streets with Neil.
PROTAGONIST
What did you find on the gold?
NEIL
Three hundred thousand at today’s price, no franks, mould marks.
Nothing. Like it came from outer space.

PROTAGONIST
Or the future.
NEIL
How?
PROTAGONIST
Dead drops. He buries his time capsule, transmits the location, then digs it up to collect whatever inverted material they’ve sent.

NEIL
Instantaneous. Where’s he bury it?
PROTAGONIST
Someplace that won’t be disturbed for centuries. What did the soil sample show?
 

NEIL
Northern Europe or Asia, radioactive. Dried blood was European.

PROTAGONIST
Pretty broad.
NEIL
This is the start of the run.
The Protagonist looks back where they came. Then up ahead.
PROTAGONIST
When does the material arrive?
NEIL
Thursday. When does Sator arrive?
PROTAGONIST
I don’t know. But he’ll be here.
NEIL
Cargo’s in a reinforced truck. Nuclear police front and back – SUVs with serious armour – you can’t break in through the windows.

PROTAGONIST
And they can’t break out.
NEIL
I don’t follow.
PROTAGONIST
You will. So, light convoy through downtown, what’s the thinking?

NEIL
A crowded, unpredictable traffic pattern makes planning an ambush almost impossible.

The Protagonist looks around at the congestion.
PROTAGONIST
They have a point. Is the convoy monitored from the air?

NEIL
No, tracked by GPS – a wrong turn or an unscheduled stop, in comes the cavalry.

Neil and the Protagonist hop a tram. The Protagonist studies the journey along the multi-lane road out of town.
 

 







Neil nods.
 
PROTAGONIST
We need big guns, guns that make the point without being fired. We need a fast car that doesn’t look fast and four heavy vehicles, all different – bus, coach, eighteen- wheeler...
 

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
One of them has to be a fire truck.
Neil looks up, interested.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Most of all, we need to set this up with nothing in the record – nothing electronic, nothing paper – I don’t want Sator ambushing us the second we spring the material. His ignorance is our only protection.

INT./EXT. MERCEDES ON TALLINN STREETS – DAY
Kat sits beside Sator in the back, staring out the window.
SATOR
Everything salvaged from Oslo’s been shipped here.

KAT
Why am I here?
SATOR
I don’t trust anyone else to assess the pieces.

EXT. FREEPORT, DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – DAY

The MERCEDES pulls into the Tallinn Freeport. Several BODYGUARDS emerge, Sator heads inside. Kat follows, looking through a metal fence – an AUDI sits there, idling. Its driver is wearing an OXYGEN MASK...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER
Kat enters. Sator is at a table covered in WEAPONS.
SATOR
See, Kat? Some of my favourites...
He picks up a MACHINE GUN.
 

SATOR (CONT'D)
Singed but salvageable, wouldn’t you say?

She stares at the weaponry as if she’s never seen anything like it before...

KAT
It’s not my area of expertise.
SATOR
That’s right. You’d never have anything to do with such things. But this is where our worlds collide.

KAT
Andrei, what is this?
SATOR
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat – the filthy business that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school. That you thought you could negotiate your way around.

VOLKOV
(in Russian, subtitled)
The convoy’s due downtown in ten.
Sator checks his watch. Nods at Volkov. Turns to Kat.
SATOR
It’s time to go.
KAT
I’m not going anywhere with you.

Sator SLAMS the machine gun back down on the table. Kat FLINCHES. Sator TURNS, enraged...

SATOR
Look at me and understand – you don’t negotiate with a tiger – you admire a tiger, until it turns on you and you feel its TRUE. FUCKING. NATURE!

Sator moves towards her – Kat pulls out a gun.
KAT
Don’t...
 

EXT. TALLINN STREET – DAY
A LARGE UNMARKED TRUCK, with an ESCORT FRONT AND BACK, makes
its stop and-start way through the downtown traffic.

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Neil watch the convoy cross an intersection, then pull forward, squeezing through traffic to get ahead. Neil raises a walkie-talkie –

YELLOW CO-PILOT
(into radio) Green? Two minutes.

INT./EXT. GREEN TRUCK, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The GREEN DRIVER nods at the GREEN CO-PILOT who holds the radio.

GREEN CO-PILOT
Check.

He puts the radio down and pulls out a LARGE AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist checks his watch – Neil speaks into the radio
–

NEIL
Yellow? Sixty seconds.
YELLOW CO-PILOT
(over radio) Sixty. Check.

NEIL
Blue? Forty-five seconds.
BLUE CO-PILOT
(over radio) Forty-five. Check.

NEIL
Red? On our way to you.

INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS
RED DRIVER and RED CO-PILOT are dressed as FIREFIGHTERS.
 

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The BMW pulls out, running behind the nuclear convoy. As the convoy passes the cross street where the green truck, a FLATBED TRUCK, is sitting, it pulls out beside them, settling in to the right of the convoy.

INT. STORAGE FACILITY – DAY
Sator steps towards Kat –
KAT
Stay right there!
She lifts the gun, intent –
SATOR
You wouldn’t kill me.
KAT
I already tried.
SATOR
You pushed me off a boat. You’re not going to shoot me in cold blood
–

KAT
My blood’s not cold, Andrei.
SATOR
No, but you’re not angry enough.
Sator edges towards Kat...
SATOR (CONT'D)
Because anger scars over into despair. I look in your eyes...

He casually GESTURES at her –
SATOR (CONT'D)
I see despair.
He SMACKS the gun out of her hands – PUNCHES her – she DROPS
–

SATOR (CONT'D)
Vengeful bitch. Living off me, pretending to be better...

With a primal, animal viciousness, Sator SPITS at Kat.
SATOR (CONT'D)
ENOUGH!
Sator KICKS her once, in the side.
 

SATOR (CONT'D)
You wanted to know when it’s better to kill you? You’ll have your answer.

He motions to Volkov, who, with a guard, lifts Kat and carries her towards the door. Sator puts an earpiece in his ear...

SATOR (CONT'D)
Tell me everything as it happens.
Volkov nods, leaving – Sator walks through a large door.
SATOR (CONT'D)
Seal us this side!

As the door shuts behind him, he walks towards a RED DOOR WITH A SMALL PORTHOLE, finding a spot in the shadows nearby...

EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The BMW watches the yellow truck, a BROADCAST TRUCK, which pulls out just ahead of the nuclear convoy... the Protagonist looks back through the BMW’s side mirror, which is CRACKED...

The BMW sees the blue truck, a WRECKER, which pulls out onto the larger street, just behind the convoy, which is now SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES by the coloured trucks.

INT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS
Volkov follows the convoy...
VOLKOV
(into radio)
Three trucks in place...
SATOR
(over radio)
Watch everything, give me all the details...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
Sator sits in the shadows, listening intently...

EXT. TALLINN STREETS – CONTINUOUS

The BMW ZIPS ahead, weaving through traffic, pulls alongside the fire truck.
 

The Protagonist, DRESSED AS A FIREFIGHTER, jumps out of the BMW and grabs onto the side of the fire truck, BANGING the side to signal the driver. The fire truck pulls out onto the three-lane highway...

INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The fire truck pulls alongside the nuclear convoy, slotting in on the left, so that the convoy is now SURROUNDED... the Protagonist CLIMBS onto the roof beside the ladder, puts on a pair of heavy-duty gloves, pulls a diagonal backpack around onto his front, checking his tools.

Blue Co-pilot and Yellow Co-pilot COUNT DOWN in unison –
BLUE CO-PILOT
(over radio)
Five, four, three, two, one, go...

Blue truck, behind the convoy, GUNS THE ACCELERATOR, as yellow truck, in front of the convoy, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES...

The two SUVS are ACCORDIONED against the nuclear truck, then CARRIED FORWARD WITH THE NUCLEAR TRUCK as the coloured trucks CLOSE FORMATION and PULL FORWARD, maintaining pace –

BLUE CO-PILOT (CONT'D)
Go yellow!
The YELLOW CO-PILOT in the broadcast truck sends out STATIC –

INT./EXT. SECURITY SUV – CONTINUOUS
The SECURITY DRIVER is trying the radio – STATIC...

INT. CONTROL CENTRE, TALLINN POLICE – CONTINUOUS

A POLICE OPERATOR is frowning, trying the radio. He calls to his SUPERVISOR –

POLICE OPERATOR
(in Estonian, subtitled)
–	Radio’s down. –
SUPERVISOR
(in Estonian, subtitled)
–	Are they still moving? –
The Police Operator checks his screen – NODS...
 

EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

TYRES HOWLING, the convoy GRINDS forward – Blue Co-pilot tosses a DYE PACK onto the windshield of the SUV – it BLASTS across the glass, obscuring the view – Yellow Co-pilot does the same in the front – the Guards are now BLIND, CANNOT OPEN THEIR DOORS OR SHOOT OUT THROUGH THE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES...

The Protagonist CLIMBS ONTO THE LADDER, lying on top... Inside, the Red Co-pilot operates the ladder controls...
The ladder SWINGS OUT AT NINETY DEGREES, hanging the Protagonist DIRECTLY OVER THE NUCLEAR TRUCK... he PULLS a
frame from his pack, unfolds it – fixes it to the roof. The ladder SWINGS him away – the frame EXPLODES – he SWINGS back through the smoke to find an OPENING and climbs into –

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist lands, gets his bearings, finds the SAFE. He reaches into his pack...

EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

An Estonian POLICE CAR pulls up behind the fire truck – the POLICEMEN spot SPARKS from the dragging bumper of the SUV – the Policeman Passenger tries his radio... STATIC...

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist affixes a CHARGE to the safe – he runs a wire, pushing back into the farthest corner – BLASTS the door open –

INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS

Watching the Police through his mirror, Red Passenger rolls down his window and props his ASSAULT RIFLE on the sill...

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist reaches into the safe... PULLS OUT an ORANGE PLASTIC CASE... reaches up to climb through the roof...

INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist, orange case in hand, CLIMBS onto the ladder
– Red Passenger SWINGS his rear-opening door out and SHOOTS OUT the engine block of the police car which DROPS BACK as –
 

The fire-truck ladder SWINGS the Protagonist back onto the fire truck – he climbs down onto the side – the BMW pulls alongside – he JUMPS into the car, which SPEEDS away...

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS
Neil, driving, glances at the orange case –
NEIL
We got it!

The Protagonist opens the latches, flips open the lid... revealing the BLACK METAL SHAPE the size of a softball.

PROTAGONIST
I’ve seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class – this is not one of them.

Neil looks back at the Protagonist. Serious.
NEIL
It’s what he’s after.
The Protagonist looks around at the surrounding traffic...
PROTAGONIST
Check the radio chatter.
Neil clicks on the radio – EMPHATIC GIBBERISH...
NEIL
I can’t understand –
PROTAGONIST
You said you spoke Estonian –
NEIL
It’s not Estonian, it’s... backwards –

Up ahead, an Audi is weaving through traffic, towards them, BACKWARDS... Neil STARES...

NEIL (CONT'D)
The hell?

The BACKWARDS-RUNNING AUDI flies at them, CLIPPING the wing mirror, ‘HEALING’ its crack. Behind them it SPINS AROUND, to CHASE them, still running BACKWARDS...

The BMW DODGES around traffic, trying to lose the backwards Audi, which pulls up to the back bumper – then ALONGSIDE – in the back is Sator, black eyes peering over a RESPIRATOR, a gun to Kat’s head. She is BOUND and GAGGED, eyes TERRIFIED –
 

Sator rolls the rear window down, holds up his hand, FINGERS EXTENDED. He COCKS the gun at Kat’s head then starts COUNTING DOWN on his fingers... the Protagonist looks down at the BLACK METAL SHAPE in the case...

NEIL (CONT'D)
You can’t give it to him!
The Protagonist LIFTS the closed case, LOWERS the window...
PROTAGONIST
This isn’t plutonium.

Sator is down to TWO FINGERS... Ahead of them in the road, the Protagonist sees a CRASHED, SMOKING, UPSIDE-DOWN SAAB...

NEIL
It’s worse, goddammit!

Both cars race towards the crashed Saab, which starts SHAKING as they approach – as they pass, THE CRASHED SAAB ROLLS VIOLENTLY OVER AND OVER between them until it is on its wheels, RACING BACKWARDS ahead of them, UNDAMAGED –

Neil regains his line, looks over at Sator who holds up his LAST FINGER... the Protagonist looks ahead to the Saab, STRUCK BY AN IDEA... the Protagonist looks at Sator –

Then TOSSES the orange case at him –
The Saab brakes, CUTTING BETWEEN THE TWO CARS...

THE ORANGE CASE GLANCES OFF ITS WINDSHIELD, INTO SATOR’S HANDS...

A forwards-driving Mercedes pulls up alongside the backwards- driving Audi. Sator opens the rear door – he and the Audi driver climb BACKWARDS into the Mercedes – LEAVING KAT IN THE ACCELERATING BACKWARDS AUDI – the Mercedes DROPS FAR BEHIND
the BMW, Neil WATCHES –
NEIL (CONT'D)
He’s getting away!
PROTAGONIST
He left her in the car!
Neil looks forward to the backwards Audi, SPEEDING AWAY –

INT./EXT. BACKWARDS AUDI – CONTINUOUS

NO ONE IS AT THE WHEEL as the car continues to accelerate – Kat lies in the back, breathing, groaning, but unconscious...
 

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist stares ahead at the backwards Audi – PROTAGONIST
Pull up alongside...

Neil looks back at the receding Mercedes, followed by the BACKWARDS SAAB... he turns – RACING to pull alongside the runaway backwards Audi, the Protagonist OPENS his door...

– Ahead, a LOGJAM of traffic...
The Protagonist FUMBLES to open the Audi door.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Kat! Kat!
In the back, Kat swings her bound legs around –

–	The LOGJAM of cars and buses LOOMS CLOSER... The Protagonist OPENS the Audi door, but his own door hits it and SLAMS IT CLOSED AGAIN...

–	The LOGJAM is DANGEROUSLY CLOSE...

The Protagonist OPENS it again, Kat JAMS it open with her feet – the Protagonist CLIMBS ACROSS and PUSHES THE BRAKE WITH HIS HAND...

The Audi SKIDS to a halt, the BMW ZOOMING PAST...
The Protagonist starts to untie Kat, fumbling with his radio
–

The BMW SKIDS to a halt, Neil JUMPS OUT – a CAR SKIDS to a halt between the BMW and the Audi – BLAM, BLAM! Neil DUCKS, avoiding GUNFIRE –

NEIL
(over radio)
Sit tight – I’m calling in the cavalry.

PROTAGONIST
What cavalry?!

SMASH!!! The Protagonist and Kat are THROWN LIKE RAG DOLLS across the car – the Mercedes has SWIPED the nose of the Audi
–

Volkov lays down COVER FIRE, pinning Neil as Sator’s men descend on the CRASHED Audi and pull the PROTAGONIST out of the car – shoving him around the back of the Mercedes. Kat is pulled from the wreck and put into the Mercedes –

As they put the Protagonist INTO THE TRUNK, he sees Sator MOVING BACKWARDS behind the line of cars, from the BMW...
 

EXT. DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – MOMENTS LATER

The TRUNK OPENS – the Protagonist is PULLED OUT. Marched towards an entrance, he sees, through a steel fence dividing the yard in two, SATOR, IN RESPIRATOR, WALKING BACKWARDS, PULLING KAT, FORWARDS, TOWARDS A DIFFERENT ENTRANCE...

The Protagonist passes a stack of SHIPPING CONTAINERS, several of which are marked OSLO FREEPORT...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is taken past the table of weapons, through a large door, and through RED DOORS with a PORTHOLE...

INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
Into A LONG CHAMBER DIVIDED IN TWO BY A GLASS WINDOW – A MUCH
BIGGER VERSION OF THE ROTAS VAULT. The Russians push the Protagonist into a chair. This side is lit by RED LIGHT.

On the other side of the glass, lit by BLUE LIGHT, Sator ‘ENTERS’ BACKWARDS, ‘PULLING’ Kat, who is now in a respirator. Sator ‘SHOVES’ her hard into a chair, removes his own respirator, ‘FLIPPING’ it up onto a hook on the wall.

The Protagonist looks into Kat’s frightened eyes... between them, embedded in a whirl of cracked glass, is a BULLET... Sator TURNS to meet the Protagonist’s gaze – his movements have the surreal edge of backwards motion as he places his GUN AGAINST KAT’S HEAD and pulls out his phone...

He holds his PHONE up and plays a recording IN REVERSE –
SATOR
(via recording)
If you’re not telling the truth, she dies.

Sator moves the phone to his lips, SPEAKING IN REVERSE... the Protagonist stares at him, bemused.

PROTAGONIST
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

Sator listens to this played backwards...
SATOR
(via recording)
You left it in the car not the fire truck, right?

PROTAGONIST
Who told you that?
 

SATOR
(via recording)
Tell me, now! Is it really in the BMW?

PROTAGONIST
I don’t know!
SATOR
(via recording)
Tell me or I’ll shoot her again!
The Protagonist looks at Kat, who is TERRIFIED –
KAT
(pleading) Tell him!

–	then at Sator –

PROTAGONIST
Leave her alone!
SATOR
(via recording)
I don’t have time to negotiate.

The Protagonist looks at the bullet hole in the glass – WISPS OF SMOKE are gathering...

PROTAGONIST
Listen to me! I can help you!
SATOR
(via recording) Three...

 

Don’t! Help me!
 
PROTAGONIST KAT
SATOR
 
(via recording) Two...

KAT
PLEASE!

A FAINT TRICKLE of glass dust rises to where the bullet is lodged in the window...

PROTAGONIST
Wait!
 

SATOR
(via recording) One...

Sator LIFTS Kat – PUSHES her up against the glass...
KAT
 
PLEASE!

NO!
 

PROTAGONIST
 

The SMOKE COALESCES as BANG! The bullet RIPS THROUGH KAT’S
SIDE on its inevitable journey to Sator’s gun. Kat SCREAMS –
SATOR
(via recording)
Next one’s a bullet to the head...
He holds up a finger – Kat is SCREAMING –
SATOR (CONT'D)
(via recording) One...

 

Please!
 
PROTAGONIST

SATOR
 
(via recording) Two...

 

No!
 
PROTAGONIST

SATOR
(via recording)
 
Three...
PROTAGONIST
Okay! Okay! The car! The BMW! I left it in the BMW!

Kat’s screams subside to moans as she PASSES OUT...
SATOR
(via recording)
We’re going to check this is real.
PROTAGONIST
It’s in the glove box!
The door OPENS behind the Protagonist –
SATOR (O.S.)
Where did you leave it?
 

The Protagonist spins around – Sator, BEHIND HIM, SMASHES his gun into the Protagonist’s cheek – THIS SATOR IS FORWARDS –

SATOR (CONT'D)
Car or truck – which one?!

Sator HITS him again – the Protagonist falls near the glass – looks up through the glass to see ‘backwards’ Sator, on the blue side, staring at him dispassionately...

SATOR (CONT'D)
Which vehicle did you leave it in?! I need to know before I go out there!

PROTAGONIST
I already told you!

Forwards Sator looks through the window at his inverse self – then turns back to the Protagonist –

SATOR
I believe you...
Sator puts his GUN to the Protagonist’s forehead –
SATOR (CONT'D)
(indicates Kat)
You wanted her here. I hope you’ll be happy together –

Sator COCKS his weapon – BLAMBLAMBLAM! – the double doors behind the Protagonist SMASH open – PARAMILITARIES BURST IN, GUNS BLAZING – the two guards are SHOT – Sator JUMPS FOR THE VAULT – HITS A BUTTON –

On the other side of the glass, INVERTED SATOR runs backwards towards the other vault door –

BOTH SATORS JUMP INSIDE AND ARE GONE –
A Paramilitary SERGEANT enters, gun drawn –
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT
Clear!
The Protagonist looks at the empty vault –
PROTAGONIST
Where’d he go?
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT
The past.
 

INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS EARLIER

Sator runs out of the turnstile – into the blue side of the room – on the other side he sees the paramilitary AMBUSH IN REVERSE... for a few seconds he watches his older self interrogate the Protagonist, then fires up his phone, steps up to the glass – the Protagonist SHOUTS PASSIONATELY –

PROTAGONIST
(via recording) It’s in the glove box!

SATOR
We’re going to check this is real.
PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Okay! Okay! The car! The BMW! I left it in the BMW!

The sound of Kat’s MOANING is BUILDING and BUILDING. Sator holds up one finger –

SATOR
Three...
PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
No!

Adds a second finger – Kat is SCREAMING now –
SATOR
Two...
PROTAGONIST
(via recording) Please!

And a third –

SATOR
One. Next one’s a bullet to the head.

Kat’s SCREAM CRESCENDOS as Sator GRABS her and pushes her up against the glass, PULLS HIS TRIGGER, ‘HEALING’ her wound –

SATOR (CONT'D)
One...
PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Wait!

Holds up two fingers –
 

 

Two...
 
SATOR

PROTAGONIST
 
(via recording) Don’t!

Sator holds up three fingers –
SATOR
Three –
PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
Listen to me! I can help you!
SATOR
I don’t have time to negotiate.
The Protagonist looks confused –
PROTAGONIST
(via recording) Leave her alone!

SATOR
Tell me or I’ll shoot her again!
PROTAGONIST
(via recording) I don’t know!

SATOR
Tell me now! Is it really in the BMW!

PROTAGONIST
(via recording) Who told you that?

SATOR
You left it in the car not the fire truck, right?

PROTAGONIST
(via recording)
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

SATOR
If you’re not telling the truth, she dies.

Sator GRABS his respirator from the hook, PULLS Kat to her feet – DRAGS her backwards through the door, down a corridor into an AIRLOCK, pulls off her respirator, puts his on...
 

INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – THE PRESENT
The Protagonist looks through the glass at Kat –
FEMALE PARAMILITARY
She’s been shot!
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT
Get her this side!

Respirator-clad Paramilitaries pull Kat out of the room. The Paramilitary Sergeant turns to the Protagonist.

PARAMILITARY SERGEANT (CONT'D)
Was she shot with an inverted round?

The Protagonist NODS. Neil enters – gestures to the Sergeant
–

NEIL
This is Ives. He’s one of us –
The Protagonist GRABS Neil, THROWS him up against the wall –
PROTAGONIST
Us?! Who are these guys?
NEIL
Priya’s. Ours.

The Paramilitaries bring Kat into the room – the MEDIC, moving SWIFTLY, examines Kat’s wound.
The Protagonist puts his arm AGAINST NEIL’S THROAT – PROTAGONIST
How did Sator know about the ambush?

NEIL
Posterity. An ambush on the streets can’t stay out of the record –

PROTAGONIST
Bullshit – he knew every move we made! Somebody talked – was it you?!

 

No.
 
NEIL

PROTAGONIST
 
At every stage, you’ve known more than you should. I’m asking you one more time. Did you talk?
 

IVES (O.S.)
Nobody talked. They’re running a temporal pincer movement.

Ives is next to the Protagonist, ready to help Neil...
PROTAGONIST
A what?
IVES
A pincer movement. But not in space
– in time. Half his team moves forwards through the event – he monitors them, then attacks from the end, moving backwards. Knowing everything.

PROTAGONIST
Except where I stashed the plutonium.

The Protagonist lets Neil go...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Which is not plutonium, is it?
NEIL
I told you – it’s what he’s after. And you just told him where it is.

PROTAGONIST
I lied.
Neil looks at Kat, bleeding out on the gurney.
NEIL
Jesus.
PROTAGONIST
He couldn’t verify from inside the room, he’d have shot her anyway.
Lying is standard operating procedure.

The Medic steps away from Kat, shakes his head.
MEDIC
It’s spread too far.
PROTAGONIST
Meaning what?
IVES
She’s going to die.
NEIL
(to Protagonist) Standard operating procedure?
(MORE)
 
NEIL (CONT'D)
(to Ives)
Can’t you stabilize inverse radiation by inverting the patient?

IVES
That takes days –
The Protagonist points at the turnstile –
PROTAGONIST
Let’s go.
IVES
We took control of this machine minutes ago – before that it’s Sator’s.

PROTAGONIST
How long will she live on this side?

MEDIC
Three hours, tops.
The Protagonist thinks. He looks at Kat, who is dying.
PROTAGONIST
I’m taking her through. I’m not going to let her die, I’ll take my chances out there.

IVES
Chances of what? We’ve got no way to bring you back.

PROTAGONIST
We find another machine.
IVES
A week ago? Where?
The Protagonist looks at Neil – they have the same idea –
NEIL
Oslo.
IVES
That facility’s impregnable. It’s inside an airport security perimeter.

PROTAGONIST
Not last week, it wasn’t. We’re going in. You might as well help.

Ives, shaking his head, joins in. As they carry Kat towards the vault door, Ives points at the glass partition –
 

IVES
This is the proving window... as you approach the turnstile if you don’t see yourself through the proving window, do not enter the machine.

 

Why not?
 
PROTAGONIST

IVES
 
If you haven’t seen yourself reverse-exit the machine, you won’t be getting out. Okay, first in, last out. Get into the turnstile, pass through – I’ll already be there with her.

PROTAGONIST
Is that gonna work?

Ives pauses, watching activity on the other side of the window –

IVES
(points) Yeah...

The Protagonist turns to see HIMSELF on the other side of the glass, MOVING IN REVERSE, wheeling KAT ‘TOWARDS’ THE VAULT DOOR –

IVES (CONT'D)
Let’s go!

Ives OPENS the door – the Protagonist takes one last look at his backwards self ‘entering’ the machine, then STEPS INSIDE
–

We follow him in as the door SHUTS behind him – he puts his back to the wall – the machine starts CLANKING like an MRI – the door opens on the other side – he STEPS OUT...

To see Ives struggling with Kat – he moves to help – Neil is already there (first in, last out).

The Protagonist looks through the glass to where he and Ives now appear to be moving backwards...

The Medic tends to Kat.
MEDIC
She’s stabilizing slowly. I’ll clean and close, the rest is time.

PROTAGONIST
How long does she need?
 

MEDIC
4 or 5 days. A week to be sure.
PROTAGONIST
(to Neil)
Figure out how to get us to Oslo – I’ve got to get back out there –

NEIL
To do what?
PROTAGONIST
To stop Sator getting away with the whatever it is I just gave him.

NEIL
You didn’t – you lied about where it was. Wait, you’re going out there for her.

PROTAGONIST
He threatened to kill her in the past... if he does, what happens to her here?

NEIL
It’s unknowable. If you’re there to make a change, you’re not here to observe its effect.

PROTAGONIST
What do you believe?
NEIL
What’s happened’s happened. We have to save her here and now. And if you go back out there you might hand him exactly what he’s after.

PROTAGONIST
Don’t let them take her back through –

 

I won’t.
 
NEIL

IVES
 
You can’t stay here.
NEIL
And we don’t have much time – so find us a nice cosy shipping container that just came off a ship from Oslo...

The Protagonist moves towards the door.	Ives steps up –
 

IVES
This is cowboy shit. You have no idea what you’re getting into if you go through that door.

PROTAGONIST
Well, I’m going, so any tips would be welcome.

Ives sees determination. Shakes his head.
IVES
Wheeler, brief him.

The female Paramilitary, WHEELER, hands the Protagonist a respirator –

WHEELER
You need your own air – regular air won’t pass through the membranes
of inverted lungs. The number-one rule – don’t come into contact with your forwards self – that’s the whole point of these barriers –

Wheeler BANGS on the proving window –
WHEELER (CONT'D)
And protective suits – if any of your particles came into contact –

The Protagonist is putting on the respirator –
PROTAGONIST
What?
WHEELER
Annihilation.
PROTAGONIST
That’s bad, right?

The Protagonist follows Wheeler into a corridor lined with RESPIRATORS and HAZARD SUITS... at the end is an AIRLOCK...

WHEELER
When you exit the airlock, take a moment to orient yourself – things will feel strange. When you run, the wind will be at your back. If you encounter fire, ice will form on your suit, as the transfer of heat is reversed. Gravity will feel normal, but appear reversed for the world around you. Don’t worry about things falling, so much as rising.
(MORE)
 
WHEELER (CONT'D)
If you see an object demonstrating unprompted instability, stay clear, it may be about to leap into the air. You may experience distortions to your vision and hearing – this is normal – light waves and sound waves are propagating away from you. This should clear as your brain adjusts.

PROTAGONIST
Can I drive a car?
IVES
Cowboy shit.
Ives and Neil are grabbing respirators...
WHEELER
I can’t vouch for the handling, friction and wind resistance are reversed. You’re inverted, the world is not. You can’t fight the prevailing wind of entropy. Don’t try flying a plane – it’d fall out of the sky. Once again, you’re inverted, the world is not – and those forces will be pushing back on you continuously.

The Protagonist turns to Neil –
PROTAGONIST
Was there a transponder on the case?

NEIL
He’ll have tossed the case –
PROTAGONIST
I’m going backwards – that’s the ball I have to follow. Give me the reader.

Neil hands him a phone. The Protagonist sticks a Bluetooth earpiece in his ear, passes into the airlock – Wheeler shuts it behind him. Then opens the OUTER DOOR...

EXT. YARD, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist emerges into a strange world – the air feels different, the friction of his feet on the asphalt feels different. He looks up at birds flying backwards... at steam contracting... at a pile of dust sucking itself bigger...

In the yard he spots the SAAB... he runs over, finds the keys sitting on the front tyre –
 

INT./EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist LOOKS in the glove box – NOTHING – LOOKS in the wheel well – NOTHING – the back seat – NOTHING. He gives up – starts the engine... pulls out, gently, feeling out the strange handling of the vehicle...

INT./EXT. SAAB, TALLINN STREETS – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist steers the car around BACKWARDS-MOVING TRAFFIC and BACKWARDS-WALKING PEDESTRIANS, MARVELLING...

People STARE at the car as it approaches, as if they already know a backwards-driven car is heading their way (which, of course, they do).

He checks the phone – a blinking dot half a mile away – he GUNS it, FISHTAILING unexpectedly...

EXT. HIGHWAY – CONTINUOUS

We see the fire fight from before IN REVERSE – Neil laying down fire from between cars, Kat carried ‘back’ to the Audi...

Behind Neil, Sator, MOVING FORWARDS, checks the glove compartment of the BMW... NOTHING. FUMING, he heads back to the Mercedes, DUCKING behind cars, bullets FLYING...

INT./EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist pulls onto a busy highway where the cars are FACING HIM, BUT MOVING IN HIS DIRECTION...

The Saab races along, the only normal-looking car on a road full of cars SPEEDING BACKWARDS...

On the phone, the flashing dot is CLOSER...

Slowing, the Protagonist spots the ORANGE CASE lying empty by the side of the road. He PULLS OVER some distance away – JUMPS out of the car – pulls out his BLUETOOTH EARPIECE and WEDGES it between the foam padding and the orange plastic...

The Protagonist heads back to his car, checks the signal from his phone... PEERS at the case...

The case SHUDDERS TO LIFE – LEAPS INTO THE WINDOW OF A PASSING CAR – THE MERCEDES –

The Protagonist PEELS OUT, DUST FLIES UP IN CLOUDS THAT DON’T
FULLY BLOSSOM as expected, but CONTRACT...

The Protagonist STRUGGLES with the wheel, trying to keep the car on the road with its unaccustomed handling...
 

PROTAGONIST
Christ!

He can see the Mercedes up ahead, weaving through traffic...

EXT. HIGHWAY, TALLINN – CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes races back up the off-ramp – the Saab follows, weaving through traffic which faces him, but travels backwards –

As the Saab gets within a couple car lengths, his phone cuts in with audio from his Bluetooth bug in the Mercedes –

SATOR
(over radio)
– the material’s not in the case –

Sound cuts in and out – FRAGMENTS of voices – he struggles to keep pace with the Mercedes – he listens hard –

SATOR (CONT'D)
(over radio)
–Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocentre– –He was lying– –it wasn’t in the BMW–

INVERTED DRIVER
(over radio) So where is it?

INT. /EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist finds a clear lane and guns the engine, tracking the Mercedes as it pulls alongside the Audi, racing ‘forwards’, and Sator, orange case in hand, climbs from the Mercedes into the Audi...

The Audi pulls alongside the BMW – the Protagonist, sensing the moment, LOWERS HIS WINDOW... Sator lifts the orange case, BUT HIS EYES ARE ELSEWHERE –

Inside the Saab, the Protagonist hears BANGING – the BLACK METAL SHAPE ‘unwedges’ from where it’s been stuck down the side of a seat – ‘BOUNCING’ around the interior –

The Saab CUTS between the Audi and the BMW –

The orange case FLIES OUT OF SATOR’S HANDS – BOUNCES OFF THE SAAB’S WINDSHIELD, ‘LANDING’ IN THE BMW –

JUST AS THE BLACK METAL SHAPE JUMPS OUT OF THE SAAB AND INTO THE (FORWARD) PROTAGONIST’S LOWER HAND...
 

Sator, SEEING THIS, YANKS the wheel – CLIPS the Saab – the Protagonist STRUGGLES for control – but the Saab SPINS AND ROLLS DOWN THE HIGHWAY, COMING TO REST ON ITS ROOF.

The Protagonist, upside down in the car, regains consciousness... fuel leaks, pooling outside the window... he sees expensive shoes approach, then Sator’s face peering in at him. In his hand is a LIGHTER.

SATOR
I saw the hand-off. You made me shoot her for nothing.

Sator tips his lighter to read his fitness tracker...
SATOR (CONT'D)
You did get my pulse above 130. No one’s done that before. Not even my wife.

Backing away, Sator DROPS the lighter, the fuel EXPLODES, THROWING THE CAR SIDEWAYS – BUT INSTEAD OF FULLY BLOOMING, THE FLAMES CONTRACT, SPARING THE PROTAGONIST WHO LIES THERE, FREEZING. HE PASSES OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER

The Protagonist comes to on a stretcher. Kat is on a stretcher next to him. Neil sits between them. The Protagonist looks at his hands, feels his face, confused.

NEIL
The heat transfer was reversed – you may be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history.

PROTAGONIST
At this point, nothing surprises.
The Protagonist looks around the shipping container.
NEIL
You left Ives and his team one hell of a clean-up.

PROTAGONIST
We’re on our way back to Oslo?
NEIL
In a Rotas shipping container.
PROTAGONIST
He’s got the material, Neil. I handed it to him on a plate.
 

NEIL
I warned you –
PROTAGONIST
‘What’s happened’s happened.’ I get it, now. But it’s tough to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.

NEIL
That’s not fair –
PROTAGONIST
You were part of this before we met. Were you working for Priya?

NEIL
No.
PROTAGONIST
Who recruited you, Neil?
NEIL
It can’t possibly do you any good to know that right now. When this is over, if we’re still standing and you still care, you can hear my life story, okay?

Kat GROANS, her eyes flicker open to see the Protagonist.
PROTAGONIST
I’m sorry I involved you.
KAT
You need to tell me what’s going on.

PROTAGONIST
Apparently, Neil here knows more about it than I do.
(to Neil) Good luck, pal.

NEIL
By telling Kat anything we’re compromising her in Priya’s eyes.

PROTAGONIST
In Priya’s eyes she’s already compromised. And she has a right to know why she might die.

KAT
I’m going to die?
 

PROTAGONIST
Not if we have anything to say about it.

 

And we do.
 
NEIL

KAT
 
Who are you?
NEIL
Let me start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics operates the same forwards and backwards, except one. Entropy...

The Protagonist moves to the back of the container, pulls out his phone, checks Neil’s attention is on Kat...

SATOR
(via recording)
–bring– –final section– –directly to the hypocentre– –with the other parts– –the algorithm–

The recording breaks up. The Protagonist puts the phone away, FLEXES his elbow, feeling out some pain... He rolls up his sleeve – there is a DARK PATCH of skin forming –

NEIL
Are you injured?
PROTAGONIST
What’s the ‘algorithm’, Neil?
NEIL
The 241 is one section of it. One out of nine. It’s a formula rendered into physical form so it can’t be copied or communicated. A black box with one function.

PROTAGONIST
Which is?
NEIL
Inversion. But not objects or people. The world around us.

KAT
I don’t understand.
NEIL
As they invert the entropy of more and more objects...

Neil holds his hands, fingers spread, pointing at each other
–
 

NEIL (CONT'D)
The two directions of time are becoming more intertwined...

He slowly brings his fingers together, into the ‘Tenet’ gesture –

NEIL (CONT'D)
But because the environment’s entropy flows in our direction...

He pushes one hand back with the other –
NEIL (CONT'D)
...we dominate. They’re always swimming upstream. It’s what saved your life – the inverted explosion was pushing against the environment.

PROTAGONIST
Pissing in the wind.
NEIL
But the algorithm can change the direction of that wind. It can invert the entropy of the world.

KAT
And if that happens?
NEIL
Oh, end of play.
PROTAGONIST
‘End of play’? Can you be a little more precise?

NEIL
Our present wiped out, our past obliterated. Everyone and everything who ever lived destroyed instantly. Precise enough?

KAT
Including my son.
Neil nods, gravely. Kat winces, clearly in pain.
NEIL
Let me sedate you – the more you sleep the faster you’ll heal.

Neil injects Kat in the arm. Her eyes close.
 

EXT. CARGO SHIP – LATER

Close on the hull, we see the water UNSPLASHING at the bow and SUCKING UNDERNEATH the stern as the ship steams majestically backwards through the cold North Sea...

INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER
BANGING wakes the Protagonist – Neil is at a peephole.
NEIL
We’re on a truck. Shouldn’t be too long now.

INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER

Neil is awake. He looks over at the Protagonist, who is examining a LESION on his right arm...

NEIL
You in pain?
PROTAGONIST
Must’ve got nicked in Tallinn. (rolls down sleeve)
I’ve been thinking... we’re their ancestors. If they destroy us, won’t that destroy them?

NEIL
Bringing us to the grandfather paradox.

 

The what?
 
PROTAGONIST

NEIL
 
The classic thought experiment – if you went back in time and killed your own grandfather, how could you have been born to commit the act?

PROTAGONIST
What’s the answer?
NEIL
There is no answer, it’s a paradox. But in the future, those in power clearly believe that you can kick Grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes and slit his throat without consequence.

PROTAGONIST
Could they be right?
 

NEIL
It doesn’t matter. They believe it, so they’re willing to destroy us.
Can I go back to sleep?
PROTAGONIST
No. I thought of something else.
NEIL
Great.
PROTAGONIST
This reversing the flow of time... doesn’t us being here now mean it never happens? That we stop them?

NEIL
Optimistically, I’d say that’s right.

PROTAGONIST
Pessimistically?
NEIL
In a parallel-worlds theory, we can’t know the relationship between consciousness and multiple realities. Does your head hurt yet?

PROTAGONIST
 
Yes.

Try sleep.
 

NEIL
 


INT. SAME – LATER

A final THUD, then STILLNESS. The Protagonist moves to the peephole, unplugs it and peers out:

The WRECKED PLANE, FLOODLIT, sitting outside the COLLAPSED WALL which has been sealed with STEEL FENCING.

PROTAGONIST
Shit. They didn’t take us inside.
NEIL
What do we do?
PROTAGONIST
We use the breach. The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

They both turn to look at the unconscious Kat.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Is she healed enough?
 

NEIL
I don’t know. I’ve never done this before.

INT. SAME – NIGHT

The Protagonist is at the peephole – the ground is WET. CLEAN- UP CREWS and INVESTIGATORS swarm backwards over the scene.
SIRENS start... Water FLOWS UP ONTO THE PLANE’S WINGS. FIRE
CREWS ‘unpack’ their equipment around the wreck...
PROTAGONIST
Fire crew’s there...
The Protagonist WINCES as he pulls his arm into its sleeve...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
We get Kat through the breach, I take care of Sator’s man and secure the vault. Then you bring her in.

NEIL
How’s the arm?
PROTAGONIST
Not good.
The Protagonist spots a HOLE in the fabric of his black suit
–	directly over the lesion on his arm...

Neil straps a respirator to the gurney – puts the mask over Kat’s face, then puts another on himself. He gives Kat a sedative.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
We move the second we hear the engines.

Neil looks at Kat, unconscious on the gurney. He TIGHTENS the straps – throws a reflective blanket over her...

The SIRENS are DEAFENING – the Protagonist flexes his arm, clearly in a lot of pain. Neil spots BLOOD dripping from the Protagonist’s wrist –

NEIL
You’re bleeding. Let me take a look
–
SUDDENLY THEY HEAR THE BUILDING WHINE OF JET ENGINES. The
Protagonist YANKS up the handle, THROWS OPEN THE DOOR –
 

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Onto PANDEMONIUM – FIRE CREWS BATTLE the blaze, chunks of metal on the ground IGNITE, SHUDDER and LEAP ONTO THE AIRFRAME... STREAMS of water RISE up onto the plane –

The Protagonist HURRIES BACKWARDS, PULLING THE GURNEY towards the plane, steering around debris that might suddenly –

A SHEET OF FLAMING METAL SPINS off the ground, shearing into them, KNOCKING the GURNEY – they duck, HOLDING ON TO THE GURNEY, the metal FLIES into the air, SLAMS into its hole on the side of the plane... the Protagonist spots a line under the fuselage, between flames, towards the breach...

PROTAGONIST
Come on!
Neil looks up as BLACK SMOKE GATHERS, FORMING A MASSIVE CLOUD
OVER THE PLANE... a SHOCK WAVE starts to BUILD in the air around them – the Protagonist PULLS Kat and Neil under the fuselage as CURTAINS of FIRE start GATHERING around the wings, CENTRED on a HALF-DESTROYED JET ENGINE –

They pass through the hole in the wall LICKED AT BY FLAMES WHICH LEAVE FROST ON THEIR CLOTHES –

As they clear into the building, DEBRIS in front of them start SHAKING – they DUCK as the MASSIVE BUILD OF ENERGY CLIMAXES in a CACOPHONOUS REVERSE EXPLOSION as THE JET ENGINE REASSEMBLES – LOOSELY ATTACHED TO THE WING, THRUSTING –

INT./EXT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist draws his gun – turns to Neil –
PROTAGONIST
I’m going in. Wait here.
The Protagonist turns, rushing up onto the loading dock –

The LOOSE JET ENGINE, under FULL THRUST, ATTACHED to the wing, SWINGS BACK AND FORTH, wreaking REVERSE HAVOC...

The Protagonist pauses, LISTENING – he can hear BACKWARDS VOICES on the other side of a ROLLER DOOR – the loose jet engine TURNS, BLASTING AIR at the Protagonist with its INVERTED THRUST – the Protagonist is SMASHED through the bottom of the roller door –
 

INT. VAULT, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
INTO HIMSELF AND NEIL, DRESSED AS BUSINESSMEN AS IN THEIR
EARLIER VISIT TO THE ROTAS VAULT – the Protagonist (wearing black clothes and gas mask) TACKLES the EARLIER PROTAGONIST (wearing business suit), the Earlier Protagonist THROWS the Protagonist onto the ground, getting his gun –

SHOUTING at him INCOMPREHENSIBLY – KICKING his INJURED ARM
AGAIN AND AGAIN – the Protagonist SCREAMS... The Earlier Protagonist puts his GUN TO THE PROTAGONIST’S HEAD... EARLIER NEIL GRABS HIS ARM, RESTRAINING him...

The Protagonist and Earlier Protagonist STRUGGLE, ROLLING across the floor with the unique physics of forward action merged with backwards action...

They STRUGGLE through the BLUE DOOR of the Rotas vault. The Protagonist gets his gun – the Earlier Protagonist STABS him in the arm with his lockpick – ‘HEALING’ his wound – ENERGIZING him –

He FLIPS the Earlier Protagonist up against the glass, LIFTS his gun – SHOOTS past the Earlier Protagonist’s head, putting a BULLET HOLE through the glass –

Glancing at the OPEN TURNSTILE DOOR, the Protagonist FIRES again, forcing the Earlier Protagonist TOWARDS the door... he looks through the proving window – no one there...

PROTAGONIST
Come on, come on...

The Protagonist FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN, forcing the Earlier Protagonist closer and closer to the open turnstile...

The Earlier Protagonist takes hold of the gun – the barrel coming around onto the Protagonist who instinctively EJECTS the magazine, REMOVES the SLIDE, tossing it aside, leaving the Earlier Protagonist with a useless STRIPPED AUTOMATIC –

Earlier Neil RACES backwards into the other half of the room
–	Through the bullet-riddled glass the Protagonist sees HIMSELF (GAS MASK, BLACK CLOTHES) RUN BACKWARDS into the room
–

The Protagonist LEAPS INTO THE TURNSTILE – we FOLLOW the Protagonist through the machine – BURSTING OUT on the other side – straight into Earlier Neil, who now MOVES FORWARDS as the Protagonist PUSHES past –

As the confrontation on the other side of the glass plays out again, FORWARDS... the Protagonist RACES for the RED DOOR, Neil in PURSUIT –
 

INT. VAULT CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist runs, pursued by Earlier Neil, skidding around the corners of the vault corridor –

Earlier Neil gets a hand on the Protagonist’s GAS MASK and YANKS – it comes off in his hands... this time we see that Neil is looking at the UNMASKED PROTAGONIST. Neil, surprised, turns and BOLTS back the way he came – the Protagonist watches him go, then TURNS –

INT. VAULT CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist races down the angled corridor –

The Protagonist SKIDS through the doorway leading out of the corridor and into the SMOKE-FILLED cargo area where he left...

INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS
Neil races up to the Earlier Protagonist, grab his arm –
NEIL
NO! Don’t kill him!

INT./EXT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS
...Neil (respirator on) guarding Kat, STRAPPED to the gurney.

Behind them, the fire crew battle the blazing plane. Neil is already looking up at the Protagonist who POINTS right – The Protagonist DUCKS THROUGH the breach, into the chaos... Neil moves BACKWARDS towards the outside...

EXT. BREACH – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist RUNS THROUGH THE SMOKE AND FLAME, DODGING
DEBRIS FALLING FROM THE PLANE... heading towards the EMERGENCY SERVICES...

The Protagonist CREEPS along the side of an AMBULANCE... the AMBULANCE DRIVER spots him in the mirror – the Protagonist DARTS in, HITTING the driver in the face –

INT. VAULT CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

Neil (moving FORWARDS) ducks back behind the corner as Earlier Protagonist (business suit) and Earlier Neil (business suit) walk backwards away from the Rotas vault.

Neil pushes Kat towards the broken roller door and pushes her inside...
 

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist SWERVES the ambulance, trying to get close to the breach – the Protagonist SPINS the ambulance around as close to the breach as possible. He JUMPS out – opens the back – PEERS into the smoke and water... waiting...

Neil EMERGES, pushing the gurney with Kat on –

INT./EXT. AMBULANCE – MOMENTS LATER
The Protagonist DRIVES, sirens blaring.
PROTAGONIST
You knew it was me coming out of that vault. Why didn’t you say?

NEIL
That’s a lot of explaining when someone’s about to put a bullet in their own brain.

PROTAGONIST
But afterwards –
NEIL
With things the same, I knew you’d be okay. What’s happened happened. If I’d told you and you acted differently... who knows? The policy is to suppress.

PROTAGONIST
Whose policy?
Neil GRINS, offering his hand –
NEIL
Ours, my friend. We’re the people saving the world from what might have been...

INT./EXT. PARKED AMBULANCE – NIGHT

Neil and the Protagonist are in the back, checking on Kat... whose eyes OPEN.

 

Kat?

I’m here.
 
PROTAGONIST KAT
 
Neil checks the dressing on her wound –
 

NEIL
Be quite a scar, but you’re okay. We did it.

KAT
Did what? Andrei’s got the algorithm. You don’t know where he is –

Neil looks at the Protagonist –
NEIL
Or when.
PROTAGONIST
Get Priya here to Oslo.
NEIL
Why?
PROTAGONIST
If I don’t do something now, in two days she’ll tell me about the 241.

NEIL
Nothing can change that.
PROTAGONIST
We’ll see. Just get her here.

EXT. OSLO WAR MEMORIAL – DAY

The Protagonist makes his way through the crowd, following an elegantly dressed lady... Priya. He takes her by the arm, away from the crowd...

PROTAGONIST
Hello, Priya.
PRIYA
What’s going on? Where’s Neil?
PROTAGONIST
Nursing Katherine Barton. Who almost died because of you.

PRIYA
What did I do?
PROTAGONIST
It’s what you’re going to do. In two days you’re going to have me dangle plutonium 241 in front of the world’s most dangerous arms dealer... I want to know why.
 

PRIYA
You let him get hold of 241?
PROTAGONIST
No. I let him get hold of the algorithm.

Priya looks at the Protagonist, surprised he knows the term.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Tell me about it, Priya.
PRIYA
It’s unique. The scientist who built it took her own life so she couldn’t be forced to make another.

PROTAGONIST
A scientist in the future?
PRIYA
Generations from now.
PROTAGONIST
Why did she have to kill herself?
PRIYA
You’re familiar with the Manhattan Project? As they approached the first atomic test, Oppenheimer became concerned the detonation might produce a chain reaction, engulfing the world.

PROTAGONIST
They went ahead anyway, and got lucky.

PRIYA
Think of our scientist as her generation’s Oppenheimer – she devises a method for inverting the world, but becomes convinced that by destroying us, they destroy themselves.

PROTAGONIST
The grandfather paradox.
PRIYA
Unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels, splitting the algorithm into nine sections and hiding them the best place she can think of...

PROTAGONIST
The past. Here. Now.
 

PRIYA
There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs. Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world. The best hiding places possible.

PROTAGONIST
Nuclear containment facilities.
PRIYA
Sator’s lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future, has been to find and reassemble the algorithm.

PROTAGONIST
Why did they choose him?
PRIYA
The necessary combination of greed and ambition. But mostly, he was in the right place at the right time.

PROTAGONIST
The collapse of the Soviet Union.
PRIYA
The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.

PROTAGONIST
And there he was. How many of the sections does he have?

PRIYA
After the 241? All nine.
PROTAGONIST
Christ. And that’s why you’re going to do it differently this time.

PRIYA
To change things? So Katherine won’t get hurt?

PROTAGONIST
So Sator won’t get the algorithm.
PRIYA
If that universe can exist, we don’t live in it.

PROTAGONIST
Let’s try. You’re going to warn me.
 

PRIYA
No. I’m not. Ignorance is our ammunition. If you’d known what the algorithm was, would you have let it fall into Sator’s hands?

PROTAGONIST
You want him to get the last section?

PRIYA
It’s the only way he’ll bring together the other eight.

PROTAGONIST
I was supposed to steal it, then lose it?

PRIYA
(smiles) Mission accomplished.

PROTAGONIST
You used me.
PRIYA
As you used Katherine. Standard operating procedure. You’ve done your part.

PROTAGONIST
My part? I’m the protagonist of this operation –

PRIYA
You’re a protagonist. (off look)
What? You thought you were the only person capable of saving the world?

PROTAGONIST
No. But I am. Because I haven’t told you where he’s assembling the algorithm, or when.

PRIYA
You’re about to.
PROTAGONIST
No, I’m not. So deal us in.
PRIYA
Why would you involve her again?
PROTAGONIST
She can get close to him.
 

PRIYA
Does he still trust her?
PROTAGONIST
He thinks she’s dead. But he used to.

PRIYA
You have started looking at the world in a new way.

PROTAGONIST
And now it’s your turn. Assuming she makes it out alive, whether or not you feel she knows too much...

PRIYA
I can’t.
PROTAGONIST
If you don’t have the authority, talk to whoever’s in charge of loose ends. I need your word that she and her son will be safe.

PRIYA
(frustrated)
What good is someone’s word in our line of business?

The Protagonist just looks at her. She NODS.
PRIYA (CONT'D)
They’ll be safe. There’s a rally point offshore at Trondheim. Get yourselves up there...

EXT. WIND FARM, NORWAY – DAY

Chinooks cross BACKWARDS through WHITE TURBINES. Service boats pull people off ladders. A large ICEBREAKER sits nearby
–

EXT. ICEBREAKER, BARENTS SEA – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist, IN RESPIRATOR, does PULL-UPS on deck, the movement ‘shaking’ snow back up onto the pipe...

PRIYA (V.O.)
Ives has a team ready to invert.
CUT BACK TO THE PROTAGONIST IN OSLO –
 

PROTAGONIST
You have a turnstile? The exact technology we’re trying to suppress?

EXT. ICEBREAKER – DAY
The Protagonist watches a CHINOOK long-line a container...
PRIYA (V.O.)
Fighting fire with fire is a treacherous business, but there are people in the future who need us to continue the algorithm’s journey into the past. You see...

Taking a look at the sea CHURNING BACKWARDS into the stern as the inverted ship ‘progresses’, he heads below deck...

CUT BACK TO PRIYA IN OSLO –
PRIYA
...Tenet wasn’t founded in the past
– it will be founded in the future.

INT. HOLD, ICEBREAKER – CONTINUOUS

Coming out of an AIRLOCK, he removes his respirator. Walks past Wheeler drilling TENET SOLDIERS – non-inverted soldiers in respirators SPAR with inverted soldiers. Neil is amongst troops practising ‘LIFTING’ weapons from the floor.

INT. CABIN, ICEBREAKER – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist enters. Kat sits at a window.
KAT
I can’t get over the birds...
The Protagonist follows her look to a bird flying backwards.
PROTAGONIST
How are you feeling?
She lifts her shirt to reveal a LARGE, JAGGED, ANGRY SCAR.
KAT
Tell me you’re going to kill him.
PROTAGONIST
I can’t.
Neil enters without interrupting. Kat rises. Steady.
 

KAT
Why not? I think you’ve probably killed a lot of people –

NEIL
Not with a dead man’s switch.
KAT
A what?
PROTAGONIST
That fitness tracker he wears...
KAT
He’s obsessive about his health.
NEIL
It’ll be linked to a switch. Probably a simple email burst, revealing the location of the dead drop, set to fire if his heart stops.

PROTAGONIST
In effect, his death activates the algorithm. He dies, the world ends
– no one dares kill him.
Kat realizes...

KAT
No, you’ve missed the point. He’s intending to end his life.

PROTAGONIST
Why?
KAT
He’s dying. Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

PROTAGONIST
And he’s taking the world with him.
KAT
If he can’t have her, no one can.
PROTAGONIST
What?
KAT
Something he said, once. He has a child, for God’s sake.

NEIL
Kat, he gets to choose the time and place for the end of the world.
What moment? What does he choose?
 

PROTAGONIST
You told me about a holiday, where you let him feel loved...

KAT
Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht.
PROTAGONIST
You said he vanished – what day?
KAT
I went ashore with Max, he flew off. I don’t know what date it was...

NEIL
The 14th. Ten days ago. He was in Ukraine, stealing a section of the algorithm from an American team.

PROTAGONIST
At the Kiev Opera siege. How do you know about that?

NEIL
The point is – he wasn’t on the yacht, so that’s his window.

KAT
To come back to that golden moment and have it be his last.

PROTAGONIST
Everyone’s last. We have to lift the algorithm from the dead drop without Sator knowing. If he believes it’s in there, he kills himself.

NEIL
And not the rest of us. Where’s the dead drop?

PROTAGONIST
Knowledge divided, friend.
NEIL
You’re not going to tell me?
PROTAGONIST
Ignorance is our ammunition. (turns to her)
But I need you back on that boat.
KAT
Why?
 

PROTAGONIST
You have to stop him killing himself until we know that algorithm is out of the dead drop.

KAT
But if I’m caught there... and my son sees... I don’t want those moments full of anguish if they’re going to be his last.

PROTAGONIST
They’re not.

INT. ICEBREAKER, BARENTS SEA – DAY
The Protagonist watches the troops prepare.
IVES (O.S.)
Cough it up. It’s time.
The Protagonist turns to face Ives.
IVES (CONT'D)
We’re working our way back to the 14th. But without knowing where the dead drop is, there’s only so much I can prepare.
(no response)
You need me to get you there.
PROTAGONIST
Know what a hypocentre is?
Ives shakes his head.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
Ground zero for an underground nuclear test. Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation at Stalsk-12 on the 14th – the dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocentre. That explosion seals up the algorithm.

IVES
Then we’d better pull it out of that hole before the bomb goes off.

INT. TURNSTILE, ICEBREAKER – DAY

Soldiers in respirators file into the turnstile. Through the proving window we see them ‘back’ into the exit... The Protagonist checks his gear at the back of the line. He sees Kat watching from the airlock. He goes to her.
 

INT. AIRLOCK – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist pulls off his respirator.
KAT
Where’s Neil?
PROTAGONIST
He must’ve already gone through...
KAT
I didn’t get to say goodbye – this is goodbye, isn’t it?

PROTAGONIST
Today’s the 14th. Offshore of Siberia – time for us to go. You keep going back another day, give you time to make it to Viet Nam.

KAT
Who gets me back on the yacht?
PROTAGONIST
I’ve got somebody good lined up. I’d like to say you don’t have to do this, but...

KAT
I once told you I didn’t need redemption. But the chance to save my child? You can’t know what that means to a mother.

PROTAGONIST
No.
KAT
The worst thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer – to let me go if I never saw my son again. I shouted, swore –

INSERT CUT: Kat FLINGS a crystal BOWL OF RASPBERRIES,
SMASHING it on a wooden deck...
KAT (CONT'D)
But he’d seen it on my face – just for an instant.

Kat looks at the Protagonist. Who says nothing.
KAT (CONT'D)
I don’t know if I hate him more for the things he’s done, or because he knows that about me. You’ve killed people you hated before?
 

PROTAGONIST
It’s not usually personal.
KAT
He’s dying, anyway. It might not even count –

PROTAGONIST
It always counts. You’re not there to kill him – you’re the backstop. If we haven’t lifted that algorithm and he kills himself, he takes us all with him, instantly.

Kat moves to the Protagonist, in close –
KAT
Just keep up your end, okay?
The Protagonist nods. She kisses him.
PROTAGONIST
When it’s over, and you’re raising your boy. Carry this –

The Protagonist hands her a DUMB PHONE.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
There may be a time and place you feel threatened. Hit talk, state your location, hang up.

KAT
Who gets the message?
PROTAGONIST
Posterity.

INT./EXT. CHINOOK – LATER
The Protagonist watches the icebreaker recede...

EXT. VAST BARREN PLAIN, DUSTED WITH SNOW – DAY

Three CHINOOKS zoom low across the barren landscape, followed by another three CHINOOKS long-lining SHIPPING CONTAINERS...

INT. CHINOOK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist sits amongst a DOZEN SOLDIERS. They watch the endless northern plain unroll beneath them...
 

EXT. TENET CAMP – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist gets off the Chinook, watching another Chinook gently set down a container. He follows the others to a tent.

INT. BRIEFING TENT – CONTINUOUS

Soldiers in folding chairs facing a screen. The Protagonist looks around – still no Neil. Ives steps up, signals for the projector: a devastated CITY, grey CONCRETE and ABANDONED industry amongst terraced strip mines...

IVES
Stalsk-12. Hidden from the world. A city where anything can happen, and today, gentlemen, for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

Ives switches to a GRAPHIC: a childishly simple diagram of a LANDING AREA, BUILDINGS, then an UNDERGROUND CAVERN...

IVES (CONT'D)
You were divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement. We
are Red team, moving forwards. Our friends out there –
(gestures at containers)
– Blue team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted. One hour from now, they had this briefing...

INSERT CUT: Neil, in RESPIRATOR, in the front row of Commander Wheeler’s briefing of BLUE TEAM. All are in respirators...

BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING –
IVES (CONT'D)
Then were dropped on the ridge above the hypocentre as close in time to the detonation as possible. Their objectives were clearance and clarification. This briefing has the benefit of their experience – and yes, some of you specialists are on both teams.

The Protagonist overhears –
RED SOLDIER 1
Why don’t they let us see them?
RED SOLDIER 2
Maybe we won’t like what happened.
 

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

A SPEEDBOAT bounces through the chop, Mahir (from the freeport heist) at the helm. Kat, beside him, shields her eyes from the glare as they head towards Sator’s yacht. They pull up some way off. A chopper sits on the yacht.

Mahir hands Kat binoculars – Kat watches her EARLIER SELF and HER SON board the tender and head for shore...

INT. BRIEFING TENT – DAY
Ives gestures across the whole area on the schematic –
IVES
The entire area is radioactive, so both teams wear full protection. To distinguish teams, wear these –

A soldier starts passing out RED ARMBANDS...

INSERT CUT: Neil, in respirator, takes a BLUE ARMBAND, and, like the rest of the team, puts it on...

BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING –
Ives points to each of the three elements in turn:
IVES (CONT'D)
Landing zone, LZ, well defended, including ground-to-air ordinance. We drop in, clear the LZ for Blue team’s evacuation... We make our way into the city proper... these buildings are abandoned, but we learned they have a turnstile in this one... so expect a bi-temporal response.

RED SOLDIER 1
They’ll have inverse ordinance?
IVES
Inverse, conventional, forwards antagonists, inverted antagonists – they have it all, and it can all end you. Got it?

Ives goes back to the diagram –
IVES (CONT'D)
On the other side of the city, the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocentre.
(MORE)
 
IVES (CONT'D)
Most of you will proceed up the hill – a splinter unit will take a tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocentre. Blue team located an entrance here –

Ives points to the city’s edge. Then to the CAVERN.
IVES (CONT'D)
The bomb is in the rock high above to trigger a collapse, sealing the cavern.

RED SOLDIER 2
How do we defuse the bomb up there?
IVES
We don’t. The explosion takes place as planned, exactly ten minutes after our landing. Everything is synchronized to that explosion.
Both teams have countdown watches – ours counts down from ten at landing, to zero at the explosion.

He holds up his wrist to display a BLOOD-RED ‘10’ –
IVES (CONT'D)
Blue team is the reverse –
INSERT CUT: a PREVIOUS BRIEFING (BLUE TEAM). NEIL watches as
Wheeler holds up her wrist to show a VIVID-BLUE ‘10’ –
WHEELER
Ten at the explosion, to zero at our extraction. If you are not at the LZ by zero, you are not leaving.

BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING –
IVES
Our job is to fail to defuse the bomb, while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.

RED SOLDIER 1
Which is?
IVES
Need to know. And you don’t. Any other stupid questions? Right, let’s get ready.

Everybody RISES. The Protagonist approaches Ives.
PROTAGONIST
I wanted to be on the first wave.
 

IVES
There is no first wave – Red team and Blue team operate simultaneously. Do not get on the chopper if you can’t stop thinking in linear terms. You want to be on the team who lifts the contents of that capsule?

PROTAGONIST
Absolutely.
IVES
That’s us. We’re the splinter unit.
PROTAGONIST
Just us?
IVES
No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field. I thought we’d manage ourselves.

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

Mahir shows Kat how to use a small pistol. Kat wears a two- piece bathing suit with a shirt over. He puts the pistol in a diver’s bag, loops the lanyard round Kat’s bare ankle.

MAHIR
It’s forty feet from the private deck to the water. Can you jump it?

KAT
I can dive it.
They hear the chopper SPIN UP. Mahir shows her a FLARE GUN –
MAHIR
Until you see my signal, you don’t let him die.

Kat nods. The chopper lifts off and ZOOMS overhead. Mahir guns the powerboat, STREAKING towards the yacht...

EXT. TENET CAMP – DAY

The Soldiers head for the Chinooks. As they pass the containers, some stare at them... the Chinooks lift off, some Chinooks rise, LIFTING the containers...

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

Mahir pulls up fifty yards from the stern of Sator’s yacht... Kat grabs the pistol bag and slips into the water...
 

INT./EXT. NORTHERN PLAIN – DAY

The Chinooks BEAT LOW over the windswept plain. Stalsk-12 appears on the horizon – terraced strip-mined land leading to a set of CONCRETESTRUCTURES FUSED TO THE EARTH...

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

Kat quietly pulls herself out of the water and onto a rear platform. She STEALTHILY makes her way up through the boat...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Chinooks long-lining containers RISE, slowing, as the other Chinooks BARREL in towards a large flat area – ANTI- AIRCRAFT GUNS start FIRING...

The Protagonist grabs his gun and LEAPS from the Chinook as it hovers close to the ground...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Chinooks long-lining containers fly BACKWARDS towards a giant DEPRESSION...

INT. CONTAINER – CONTINUOUS
Neil looks out a peephole –
WHEELER
We’re coming in on the shock wave... hang on, people! –

Neil GRABS his belts as WHUMMMMM!!!! The container SHUDDERS –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The SHOCK WAVE CONTRACTS – the Chinook ‘SURFING’ backwards in on the shock as it approaches the hypocentre... ENERGY BUILDING... GROUND LIFTING AND FLATTENING...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist joins a unit of Red team soldiers who CHARGE an antiaircraft emplacement TAKING IT OUT BEFORE IT CAN FIRE ON THE SLOW-MOVING CHINOOKS...

The Protagonist uses his assault rifle to take out a gunemplacement. Ives uses an inverse grenade to violently ‘reassemble’ an enemy gun emplacement out of existence, shredding the enemy with reverse shrapnel...
 

IVES
Draw them back into the city, away from Blue team...

The Chinooks drop down, land the containers – the Protagonist looks back to see, a hundred metres away, the containers OPEN
–	Blue team ‘SCRAMBLING’ BACKWARDS from the containers... SOME CARRY INJURED COMRADES, ALL SEEM EXHAUSTED...

The Protagonist and Red team press forward, blasting at the remaining enemy troops who run for the cover of the city... the Protagonist checks his watch – a BRIGHT-RED ‘9:59’, ‘9:58’...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The reverse explosion PEAKS. SUDDEN CALM as the Chinooks place the containers down – they open and Blue team runs out, ‘FORWARDS’, Neil at

the head, guns raised, BLASTING at the ENEMY SOLDIERS on the ridge... Neil checks his watch – a BRIGHT-BLUE ‘9:57’, ‘9:56’... he turns to see a GREY TRUCK ‘REVERSING’ towards the hole, tyres sucking up dust... a rope from its rear hitch TAUT into the hole...

BANG! BANG! SHOTS are sucked out of the ground around him – Blue team FORCES the enemy away from the hole, towards Red team (whose members fight ‘backwards’) – Neil shouts to Wheeler –

NEIL
Draw their fire! Pull them away...
He RACES down the ridge, following Wheeler...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Kat comes out to find a JUNIOR CREW MEMBER cleaning up a SMASHED BOWL OF RASPBERRIES. He looks up at her, surprised.

JUNIOR CREW MEMBER
Ma’am? We thought you’d gone ashore.

KAT
I snuck back to surprise Andrei.
JUNIOR CREW MEMBER
The Boss left...
He trails off – they hear an INCOMING CHOPPER.
 

KAT
I’ll get the mess. Have Mr Sator find me here. Don’t tell the others.

The Junior Crew Member nods, leaves – Kat moves to the RAIL, checks Mahir in the distance, the DAYBED, the water HOSE...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist, Ives and Red team head towards the large concrete turnstile building on the outskirts of the city –

The Protagonist sees Wheeler running backwards towards a BUNKER on their right which UNEXPLODES –

–	GUNFIRE CRACKLES around them, pinning them down...

They hit the bunker with an RPG, then race around the left of the turnstile building...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler leads Blue team down the hill – ‘chasing’ the enemy who run BACKWARDS – a BLUE TEAM member TRIGGERS A LANDMINE –
another triggers an INVERSE LANDMINE –
WHEELER
Hit the deck! Mines!

As Blue team goes to the ground, Neil sees mines start to EXPLODE/IMPLODE in a wave towards him as the GREY TRUCK RACES BACKWARDS down the hill through the minefield, REVERSE- TRIGGERING THE MINES – Neil DIVES out of the way, almost run over...

Then gets up to follow the ‘path’ of the grey truck...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Kat unzips the diver’s bag, feels the handle of the gun, then slides the bag under the daybed, checking she can reach. She moves to the rail, crouches to UNCLIP the bottom safety cable. She looks at Mahir’s boat across the water...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Ives leads Red team into the deserted concrete structures via an efficient cover-and-move formation... the Protagonist shelters behind LARGE CONCRETE CHUNKS. Which VIBRATE...
GATHERING ENERGY...
 

The Protagonist JUMPS AWAY as the chunks RIP FROM THE GROUND, BOUNCING VIOLENTLY, DUSTILY OFF EACH OTHER AND FLYING UP INTO A GAP IN THE SIDE OF A BUILDING as an INVERSE RPG ZIPS back
up into a WINDOW –

Ives has spotted the window and calls for an RPG to ‘follow’ the inverse one, BLASTING the building... the Protagonist checks his watch – ‘8:10’, ‘8:09’...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil checks his watch – ‘8:08’, ‘8:07’... he heads downhill, towards the city, where the rest of Blue team BEAT BACK the enemy...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Kat hoses the raspberries and glass from the deck... Sator appears, watching as she turns the water on herself.

SATOR
They told me you’d gone ashore.
KAT
They told me you’d flown off.
SATOR
I came back. To see you and Max.
KAT
Max is on shore with Anna. We need time, just you and me. After what -

SATOR
I was joking. A stupid joke –
KAT
You think I’m a terrible mother.
SATOR
We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.

KAT
I want things to be better, Andrei.
She moves towards him. Sator nods. Picks up the phone –
SATOR
Have the captain turn the boat so we’ll see the sunset from here.
 

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist RUNS across the street, FIRING at the enemy... he SPOTS the TUNNEL ENTRANCE between two buildings.

PROTAGONIST
Ives! Splinter unit here!
Ives nods. RACES over, drawing fire the whole way...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12

Neil races into the city streets... he sees Commander Wheeler and a BLUE SOLDIER take shelter in a large jagged BREACH in the ground-floor wall of a massive structure.

Neil is FORCED to hit the deck, ducking INVERTED fire all around... he looks over at Wheeler, and sees DUST GATHERING AROUND THE BREACH...

NEIL
Wheeler! Get out of there! Wheeler!

Wheeler hears him – tries to grab the Blue Soldier – MASSIVE CHUNKS OF CONCRETE SCRAPE OVER NEIL’S HEAD, FLYING TOWARDS WHEELER, who DIVES CLEAR – the wall REASSEMBLES ON TOP OF the
Blue Soldier, CRUSHING HIM...

Neil winces. Starts crawling for better cover... checks his watch – ‘6:24’,‘6:23’...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON
Sator looks past Kat to the lowering sun.
SATOR
It’s going to be a beautiful sunset. I’ll get Max brought back – we should share the moment with him.

Sator picks up the phone. Kat looks at the shore, uneasy...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Ives and the Protagonist shelter as Red team exchanges fire with the Enemy further up the street. The Protagonist checks his watch – ‘5:15’, ‘5:14’...

PROTAGONIST
Let’s go. We’re running out of time.
 

IVES
If they see us, it’s all for nothing.

PROTAGONIST
We need a distraction.
Ives looks ahead to the LEANING RUIN OF A BUILDING TOP...
IVES
Don’t worry about that...

EXT. CITY STREETS – DAY

Neil checks his watch – ‘5:10’, ‘5:09’... frustrated, pinned down, he looks around for a way to break cover...

Commander Wheeler, with the rest of Blue team, SHELTERS in the shadow of the RUINED BASE of a building, pinned by ENEMY FIRE from the base of the building...

WHEELER
RPG! Take out the base – on my mark
–
She checks her watch – ‘5:04’, ‘5:03’... The BLUE RPG SOLDIER takes aim...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist spots SMALL DEBRIS ROLLING across the street... GATHERING MOMENTUM...

PROTAGONIST
Ives!

Ives sees LARGER and LARGER debris is ROLLING down the street towards the LEANING RUIN OF A BUILDING TOP...

IVES
It’s about to get distracting...
He signals a RED RPG SOLDIER...
IVES (CONT'D)
On my mark!
He looks at his watch – ‘5:01’, ‘5:00’ –
IVES (CONT'D)
Fire!
The leaning ruin THRUSTS UPWARDS –
 

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler watches as the Leaning Ruin’s UPPER STOREYS REASSEMBLE, as its BASE EXPLODES...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist takes cover as the Leaning Ruin’s BASE REASSEMBLES as its UPPER STOREYS EXPLODE... the Protagonist and Ives race at the tunnel entrance – the GREY TRUCK RACES at them as they dive for the tunnel...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler ducks as the weight of the upper storeys COLLAPSES the building...

Neil lifts his head after the EXPLO/IMPLOSION. Clear. He gets up and starts RUNNING...

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist and Ives RACE into the tunnel, HITTING A TRIPWIRE WHICH BLOWS THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE DOWN BEHIND THEM AS THEY JUMP INSIDE...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Sator hangs up. He holds a SILVER PILL in the sunlight, studying it...

KAT
What’s that?
SATOR
I borrowed it from the CIA.
KAT
But what is it?
SATOR
The way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper.

KAT
I don’t understand.
SATOR
When I take this, it’s all over.
KAT
Then don’t take it, yet.
Sator looks at her, needing her to care.
 

 

Why not?
 
SATOR

KAT
 
We’ve got the sunset coming and a little vodka left...

SATOR
And Max will be here soon... they thought it was you, not Anna, on shore with Max.

Kat steps up in front of Sator, seductive...
KAT
As long as you can tell the difference...

Sator smiles appreciatively, but pulls out his phone –
SATOR
A moment’s business, my love...

EXT. MAHIR’S BOAT – CONTINUOUS
Mahir checks his radio –
IVES
(over radio)
Not clear. Repeat, not clear...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY
The Protagonist and Ives look back at the COLLAPSED ENTRANCE
–

PROTAGONIST
We’re committed now.
They turn and RACE through the mining tunnel...
IVES
(into radio)
Just hold tight – we’re almost there...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil spots SATOR’S GREY MI8 OVERHEAD, a rope hanging down. Across the street he sees VOLKOV REVERSE-EXIT the tunnel mouth, CROUCHING to ‘DERIG’ a tripwired booby trap, carrying it towards the chopper, then LEAPING up onto the line – RISING from the streets...
 

Neil STARES. CONCERNED. Checks his watch – ‘4:10’, ‘4:09’... Then TAKES OFF, SPRINTING –

WHEELER
Neil!

She watches him go ahead, then signals Blue team to keep pushing forward...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist and Ives run down the tunnel... they slow as they see a BODY, blue armband, lying on the ground on the opposite side of a SET OF BARS at the end of the tunnel.

They can see into the hypocentre, the GIANT ATOMIC-HEWN CAVERN, daylight above, CAPSULE on the rock floor next to the mouth of a BORE HOLE. The Protagonist checks his watch – ‘4:06’, ‘4:05’ ... Ives checks the ELECTRONIC LOCK –

IVES
We don’t have anything big enough to blow this. Try him –

The Protagonist reaches through the bars and checks the body
–	FREEZES: attached to a zip, a TALISMAN – A COIN WITH A HOLE HANGING FROM A SMALL LENGTH OF ORANGE AND YELLOW STRING...

The Protagonist looks at it, quizzical, rises –
PROTAGONIST
Nothing. Can you pick it?
SATOR (O.S.)
I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock...

WHAM! Ives goes down – SHOT BY VOLKOV, bullet SPARKING off his helmet – on the other side of the bars – gun pointed at the Protagonist, FIELD RADIO held out... Sator’s voice ECHOES through the tunnel –

SATOR (CONT'D)
(over phone)
How do you like where my journey began, and yours ends?

Volkov takes the Protagonist’s gun. Forces him to push Ives’s gun through the bars.

PROTAGONIST
A little radioactive for my taste.

Volkov drops the guns into the water, places the radio by the bars...
 

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Sator steps away from Kat as he speaks quietly into the phone.

SATOR
My fate was always bound up with radiation. We’d work where no one else would. We made a devil’s bargain – money for time. We sold our futures.

Kat looks at Mahir’s boat. Nothing. She looks to the shore. Far in the distance, she can see the TENDER APPROACHING...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist looks at Volkov. At the bars between him and the capsule...

PROTAGONIST
Now you’re making the same mistake for the entire world.

SATOR
(over phone)
It wasn’t a mistake. I made the bargain I could. What was yours? You fight for a cause you barely understand. With people you trust so little you’ve told them nothing about what you’re doing. When I die the world dies with me. And your knowledge dies with you. Buried in the tomb like an anonymous Egyptian builder sealed in the pyramid to keep his secret...

INT. TURNSTILE BUILDING, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil comes into the turnstile room... he watches ENEMY TROOPS enter/exit the machine, inverting to join the battle. He waits for his chance... the room is empty... he sees himself through the proving window, and RUNS at the machine...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING
Sator speaks into his phone –
SATOR
Your faith is blind. You’re a fanatic.
 

PROTAGONIST
(over phone)
What’s more fanatical than trying to destroy the world?

Kat moves towards Sator, but he raises a finger...
SATOR
I’m not. I’m creating a new one. Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided. Entropy inverts the same way the magnetic poles have switched 183 times over the millennia. Now time itself switches direction.

Sator looks out at the lowering sun...
SATOR (CONT'D)
The same sunshine we’ve basked in will warm the faces of our descendants generations from now.

Kat looks at Mahir’s boat. Nothing. She looks to shore, watching the TENDER APPROACHING...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY
The Protagonist looks at his watch – ‘2:12’, ‘2:11’...
PROTAGONIST
How can they want to destroy us?
SATOR
(over phone)
Because their oceans rose and their rivers ran dry. Don’t you see –?
Their world shrivelled because of us. They have no choice but to turn back, there’s no life ahead of them. And we’re responsible.
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?

PROTAGONIST
Yes. Each generation looks out for its own survival.

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
Sator looks out at the glittering water –
SATOR
That’s exactly what they’re doing.
 

PROTAGONIST
(over phone)
Sure, but not you. You’re a traitor. Bringing death to all because you have no life of your own left.

SATOR
When I’m done, life continues.
PROTAGONIST
(over phone) Not your son’s.

SATOR
My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending... do you think God will forgive me?

PROTAGONIST
(over phone)
For killing your son? No.
SATOR
He should understand – he killed his own.

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil, FORWARDS NOW, spots a GREY TRUCK outside the turnstile building – he jumps in, FIRING IT UP –

RACING THROUGH THE STREETS, PAST THE IMPLODING/ EXPLODING
BUILDING, racing for the tunnel mouth, trying to head off the Protagonist and Ives –

NEIL
Wait! Wait!

They dive into the tunnel, which COLLAPSES. Neil sets his sights on the hypocentre ridge above, GUNS the engine...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler leads Blue team towards the CHINOOKS LOWERING CONTAINERS... as they carry their wounded and lurch towards the containers, they see Red team ‘REASSEMBLING’ the anti- aircraft guns...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist watches Volkov pick up a BLACK, METAL, GEOMETRICALLY COMPLEX BAR... the algorithm.
 

PROTAGONIST
You don’t believe in God. Or a new future. Or anything outside your own experience.

SATOR
(over phone)
That’s all any of us knows. The rest is belief, and I don’t have it.

PROTAGONIST
Without it you’re not human. You’re a madman.

SATOR
(over phone) Or a god of sorts.

PROTAGONIST
Like I said.

Volkov slowly backs towards the capsule with the algorithm... The Protagonist looks down at Ives – whose hand is MOVING...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
A BEEP. Sator checks his watch.
SATOR
Our time is up.
He looks across at Kat standing by the rail.
SATOR (CONT'D)
I’ll give my wife your love.
PROTAGONIST
(over phone)
You’re forgetting, I haven’t met her, yet.

SATOR
That’s right, after you meet her, she dies. I’ll just give her my love, instead.

INT. HYPOCENTRE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Volkov seals the capsule – hooks it to a winch... the Protagonist watches Ives’s hand emerge with a SIDEARM... Volkov raises the capsule up over the mouth of the DEEP BORE HOLE, then steps back, preparing to release the winch and drop the capsule into the well...
 

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – SUNSET
Sator goes to hang up, pauses... an afterthought –
SATOR
Volkov?

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS
Volkov RUSHES FORWARD with his gun...
SATOR
(over phone; in Russian, subtitled)
– Shoot him in the head. –

Volkov PULLS HIS TRIGGER – but the Dead Tenet Soldier has ‘RISEN’ to be in front of the gun ‘ABSORBING’ the bullet – then LEAPING to one side, ALIVE –

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS
Sator hears the shot, SATISFIED – Kat pulls the phone away –
KAT
Enough business, Andrei...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist DIVES to where Ives is lying, GRABS his gun – Volkov TURNS, RUNNING FOR the winch-release –

PROTAGONIST  WAIT! WAIT!

He FIRES at Volkov, who goes down just short of the winch...

Ives struggles to his feet, checking his watch – ‘1:07’, ‘1:06’...

Hearing BEEPS, Ives looks up. THE LOCK is open –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

Neil RACES up the slope to the ridge – through the MINEFIELD, setting off personnel mines in his wake, NARROWLY AVOIDING RUNNING HIMSELF OVER...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING

As Kat pours him a drink, Sator looks out at the glowing horizon, fiddling with the silver pill... he POINTS –
 

SATOR
Tomorrow the sun will rise in that same spot. For the first time in history. Because I’ve told it to.
(looks at her like she’s a loyal dog)
You have no idea what I’m talking about, do you?

She looks at him, smiles sweetly.
KAT
It sounds terribly important, Andrei.

He reaches for her – she gets up, moves to the rail –
SATOR
Where’re you going?
She grabs the hose, starts spraying herself – KAT
Aren’t you hot?
Kat sprays the deck in front of the rail –
SATOR
What’re you doing, now?
KAT
I spilled sunscreen.
SATOR
So what?
KAT
It’s slippery.
SATOR
Just come here...

She looks at Sator lying on the daybed like an appalling emperor. Moves towards him. Grabs the sunscreen.

KAT
Turn over.
SATOR
The sun’s almost gone.
KAT
You’ll like it.

He rolls over, obedient. She squirts a large dollop across his back. Looks up at Mahir’s boat, hopeful. Nothing.
 

She checks her watch as she lazily smears the sunscreen across Sator’s back. He groans. Kat watches the TENDER APPROACHING, she can just make out HERSELF AND HER SON...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist watches the Dead Tenet Soldier RACING BACKWARDS from the gate, out of the tunnel –

IVES
COME ON!

The Protagonist TURNS – Ives swings the gate open – they RACE through, just before it closes, SLAMMING SHUT behind them –

IVES (CONT'D)
Tunnel’s sealed!

The Protagonist steps over Volkov, STRUGGLES with the capsule, it swings, HANGING precariously over the well...

IVES (CONT'D)
(into radio) Mahir, do you copy?

EXT. MAHIR’S BOAT – EVENING
Mahir looks through binoculars, FRUSTRATED, flare gun ready –
IVES
(over radio) Hold! Repeat, hold!

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil REVERSES towards the hole – jumps out, pulling a line from the rear winch...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – SUNSET

Kat looks at Mahir’s boat. Nothing. She checks her watch... looks down at the tender approaching – it’s close enough she can clearly see HERSELF CHATTING AND LAUGHING WITH MAX... she jumps up from the daybed, holding the diver’s bag. Sator looks up at her, surprised.

KAT
I can’t do this.
SATOR
Don’t spoil this moment, Kat.
KAT
I can’t let you think you’ve won...
 

Sator looks at her, suddenly wary...
SATOR
What are you talking about, Katherine?

KAT
I’m not letting you go to your grave thinking we’re all coming with you. I can’t give you that –

She pulls out the SILENCED PISTOL. He is UTTERLY UNAFRAID.
KAT (CONT'D)
You’re dying alone, Andrei.
SATOR
(contemptuous) No, I’m not.

KAT
Andrei, look in my eyes. Which do you see, despair... or anger?

SATOR
What?
KAT
I’m not the woman who could find love for you even though you’d scarred her on the inside...

Kat pulls up her shirt to reveal the MASSIVE, ANGRY SCAR –
KAT (CONT'D)
I’m the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.

Sator realizes he’s been conned – LUNGES FOR HER –
SATOR
You –!
KAT SHOOTS HIM IN THE UPPER CHEST – his hands go to his chest
–	he GASPS, air leaking from his lungs... Kat ROLLS Sator off the daybed onto his back – he GURGLES – she GRABS his legs – SLIDES HIM AT THE GAP BELOW THE RAIL –

Sator SHOOTS off the deck, TUMBLING DOWN to the sea – his head CRACKS on the rear platform as he HITS the water –

EXT. MAHIR’S BOAT – CONTINUOUS

Mahir lowers his binoculars, STARTLED, as he sees Sator’s body pitch into the sea –
 

MAHIR
(into radio)
She’s killed him! She’s killed him!
Mahir GUNS the engine, racing towards the yacht...

INT. HYPOCENTRE, STALSK-12 – DAY
The Protagonist opens the capsule, revealing the algorithm –
IVES
She jumped the gun – she killed him!

The Protagonist looks at Ives, ashen – A LINE DROPS BETWEEN THEM –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

Neil is at the wheel of the truck. Through the rear-view mirror he looks at his line running into the hole. Through the windshield he watches Red and Blue soldiers finish loading and LIFT OFF. He checks his watch – ‘00:09’, ‘00:08’...

NEIL
Fuck it –

He GUNS it, PULLING AWAY FROM THE HOLE –

INT. HYPOCENTRE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Ives are YANKED into the air, the Protagonist CLUTCHING the algorithm – as they approach the rocky edge of the hole, Ives raises his boots to cushion the
–	IMPACT! They BOUNCE PAINFULLY over the lip –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The truck DRAGS them along the rocky ground, away from the hole as... BOOOOM!!!! THE ROCKY GROUND BUCKLES WITH FORCE –

SMOKE and FLAMES BLAST up out of the hole in an ANGRY PLUME –

The ground around the hole COLLAPSES IN AN EVER-GROWING RADIUS –

The line SNAPS, leaving the Protagonist and Ives TUMBLING to a stop... The SUBSIDENCE approaches, SLOWING, SLOWING... the ground OPENS UP under the Protagonist – Ives GRABS HIM – the Protagonist has the algorithm in his hands, Ives PULLS him back onto solid ground...
 

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler PULLS a last Blue team soldier into the container as her watch hits ZERO – the container door SLAMS shut –

BLUE TEAM SOLDIER
Do you think they made it?

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – SUNSET

Kat picks up the shell casing, drops it in the diver’s bag, zips it up, attaches the lanyard to her ankle, sprays down the deck, WASHING away BLOOD and SUNSCREEN...

Kat steps up to the railing. Watches Mahir, down below, getting a line on Sator’s body. Kat glances over at the TENDER ARRIVING WITH HER EARLIER SELF AND HER SON... Kat DIVES, ARCING GRACEFULLY THROUGH THE SUNSET...

Kat’s earlier self, stepping onto the yacht, catches a glimpse of a graceful form SLICING into the water. She looks, CURIOUS, but Max TUGS her sleeve and she turns.

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – CONTINUOUS

On Mahir’s SPEEDING boat, Kat hands Mahir the diver’s bag and looks up ahead to the last light of day...

PROTAGONIST
(over radio)
Kat, you jumped the gun!
Mahir hands her the radio –
KAT
I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t let him die thinking he’d won. And I knew you’d find a way.

Silence. She glances Mahir, suddenly concerned –
KAT (CONT'D)
Wait, you found a way? We’re okay, right?

PROTAGONIST
(over radio)
Yeah. We found a way. Be safe.
Mahir’s boat SPEEDS AWAY through the twilight...
...DRAGGING Sator’s body behind.
 

EXT. WINDSWEPT PLAIN OUTSIDE STALSK-12 – EVENING

A Chinook swirls snow around the blasted ruins... Ives and the Protagonist slump, bruised, exhausted, gas masks off, breathing hard. On the ground between them – the matte-black algorithm... Neil approaches, removing his gas mask...

PROTAGONIST
I thought you were inverted.
NEIL
Changed gears halfway – you needed help here.

IVES
We needed help down there. (to Protagonist)
How’d you get that lock open?
PROTAGONIST
It wasn’t me.
(to Neil)
Didn’t your team need you?
NEIL
I’ll get them on the next pass. Right, Ives?

IVES
Once I’ve caught my breath.

The Protagonist reaches for the algorithm – Ives PULLS it out of his reach – his gun laying casually across his leg. As Neil and the Protagonist watch, Ives takes his weapon in hand, gets to his feet... He lifts the algorithm... looks around at the deserted plain above Stalsk-12...

IVES (CONT'D)
Nice and private.
Ives SEPARATES the algorithm into THREE COMPONENTS – PROTAGONIST
No one who’s seen this leaves the field...

IVES
We hide it, we end our lives. It’s the only way to be sure.

Ives TOSSES them each one component...
IVES (CONT'D)
But as to when...
Ives HOLSTERS his sidearm.
 

IVES (CONT'D)
Maybe that’s every man’s decision to make for himself.

NEIL
You’re not going to kill us?
IVES
If I ever find you I will.
NEIL
But you won’t look too hard.
IVES
Yes, I will.

Neil shakes his head, smiling at this. Ives heads towards the Chinook. Neil and the Protagonist watch him go...

NEIL
You’re not heading back to London to check on Kat, are you?

PROTAGONIST
Of course not. That would be too dangerous.

NEIL
Even from afar.
PROTAGONIST
Even from afar.
Neil thinks of something. Looks at Ives –
NEIL
Ives, wait!

Neil takes his section of the algorithm, REATTACHES it to the Protagonist’s.

PROTAGONIST
You’re really going back in?
NEIL
I’m the only one who could’ve got that door open in time, right Ives?

Ives looks at Neil, sizing him up.
IVES
I don’t have any locksmiths as good as you.

Neil turns to the Protagonist, grabs his BACKPACK...
 

NEIL
See? That’s me in there, again. Weaving another pass in the fabric of this mission.

Neil SWINGS his pack onto his back, revealing a TALISMAN – A COIN WITH A HOLE TIED to the zip WITH ORANGE AND YELLOW THREAD –

PROTAGONIST
Neil, wait.
NEIL
We just saved the world – we can’t leave anything to chance.

The Protagonist thinks. Struggles.
PROTAGONIST
But can we change things? If we do it differently...?

Neil looks back at the Protagonist. Sees his struggle...
NEIL
What’s happened’s happened. (smiles)
Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world, not an excuse to do nothing.

PROTAGONIST
Fate?
NEIL
Call it what you want.
PROTAGONIST
What do you call it?
NEIL
Reality. Now let me go.
The Protagonist lets him walk, tears welling up... CALLS OUT
–

 

Hey!
 
PROTAGONIST
(Neil turns)
 
You never did tell me who recruited you.

NEIL
(smiles)
Haven’t you guessed by now? You did. Just not when you thought. You have a future in the past. Years ago for me. Years from now for you.
 

PROTAGONIST
You’ve known me for years?
NEIL
(nods)
For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship.

PROTAGONIST
But for me it’s just the beginning?
NEIL
And we get up to some stuff. You’re gonna love it. You’ll see. This whole operation is a temporal pincer.

 

Whose?
 
PROTAGONIST

NEIL
 
Yours. You’re only halfway there. I’ll see you at the beginning, friend.

Neil turns. Follows Ives to board the Chinook. The Protagonist watches him go...

NEIL (V.O.)
We’re the people saving the world from what might have been...

The Protagonist looks down at the algorithm in his hands.
NEIL (V.O.)
The world will never know what could’ve happened...

He pulls up his collar and walks into the snow...

EXT. SCHOOL GATES – AFTERNOON
Kat is walking up the road to the school gates.
NEIL (V.O.)
...and even if they did they wouldn’t care...

She feels something wrong. Looking across the road, she sees a car with tinted windows shadowing her.

NEIL (V.O.)
...because no one cares about the bomb that didn’t go off...

She gets out the dumb phone the Protagonist had given her...
 

NEIL (V.O.)
...just the one that did...

INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

Priya is in the front passenger seat. The DRIVER next to her has a GUN and SILENCER sitting on his knee...

PRIYA
Do it before the boy comes out.

The rear door opens – a dull thud – the Driver is SHOT by a silenced pistol –

PROTAGONIST (O.S.)
That’s your idea of mercy?

Priya turns – the Protagonist has a gun to the back of her seat.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
You gave me your word.
PRIYA
And I told you what it would be worth. Here. Today. How did you know?
He holds up a dumb phone, plays a voicemail – KAT
(via recording)
Cannon Place, 3 o’clock, it’s –
PROTAGONIST
Posterity.

EXT. SCHOOL GATES – CONTINUOUS
Kat hits send, speaks into the phone –
KAT
Cannon Place, 3 o’clock, it’s probably nothing...

INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS
The Protagonist watches Kat.
PROTAGONIST
I told you you’d have to start looking differently at the world.

PRIYA
I have to tie up the loose ends.
 

PROTAGONIST
That was never your job.
PRIYA
Then whose was it?
The Protagonist brings his focus back to Priya.
PROTAGONIST
Mine. I realized I wasn’t working for you. We’ve both been working for me... I’m the protagonist.

PRIYA
Then you’d better tie up those loose ends.

He shoots her through the seat back. She slumps forward.
PROTAGONIST
Mission accomplished.

The Protagonist looks across the road. The kids stream out... Kat sees Max coming, takes one last look at the dark car...

NEIL (V.O.)
...but it’s the bomb that didn’t go off...

Kat shakes her head, smiling at her own folly, looks at the phone like it’s silly –

NEIL (V.O.)
...the danger no one knew was real...

She tosses the phone carelessly into her bag.
NEIL (V.O.)
That’s the bomb with the real power to change the world.

The Protagonist watches Kat and Max walk away. Max offers Kat his hand and we –

Water slaps hollow metal, metal knocks creaking wood... Super title:
DUNKIRK

FADE IN:

Paper. Falling like snow. Six young, filthy Tommy's raise their heads along a deserted street, checking rubbish bins, windows... One crouches to check a coiled garden hose. He tries the tap - nothing...

Title 1:

THE ENEMY HAVE DRIVEN
THE BRITISH AND FRENCH ARMIES TO THE SEA

One Tommy plucks paper from the air... Propaganda leaflets showing their position... “YOU ARE SURROUNDED”....

Title 2:

TRAPPED AT DUNKIRK, THEY AWAIT THEIR FATE

He wads the leaflets up, crouches, drops his trousers... The Tommy with the hose carefully lifts each side...

Title 3:

HOPING FOR DELIVERANCE

He gets a tiny dribble of water which he licks from the nozzle -

Title 4:

FOR A MIRACLE

BLAM BLAM BLAM! Tommy jolts, grabs his trousers. All six race away from us, towards a fence twenty yards away. One by one, five are shot down. The survivor climbs the fence. Gunfire bursts through the fence, ten feet away -

Tommy tries to reload his rifle - fingers struggling with the magazine, training forgotten. Gunfire splinters the fence, five feet away -

Tommy thrusts his index finger into the breech of his rifle again and again, scraping skin. A round jumps into the chamber -
 

Gunfire three feet away -

Tommy tries once, twice - slides the bolt forward - Gunfire right next to him -
Tommy spins around, fires blind until empty, scrambles out the back. He races down narrow Dunkirk streets. Breathing. Kit jangling... Building after building... He rounds a corner
-

BLAM! Bullets hit dirt and bricks near him. The street ahead is barricaded, manned by French troops.

TOMMY ANGLAIS! AINGLAIS!

The French stop firing and wave him through.

He scrambles over their sandbag barricade, taking in their dirty frightened faces as he passes...

A French Soldier grabs him...

FRENCH SOLDIER
Allez, Anglais.

Tommy’s mouth opens at the man’s bitterness.

FRENCH SOLDIER (CONT’D)
(contempt) Bon voyage.

He shoves Tommy down the street behind their protection.

Gunfire behind. Tommy takes off again, hurtling down the dark street, heading towards the blazing light of -


EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS

The longest, widest beach he’s ever seen, sunlight dazzling off the water, endless dark fences snaking across the sand and out into the water. Tommy squints - not fences, lines of men, hundreds of thousands of men...

Tommy looks around, clutching his stomach. He clambers over a dune, feverishly undoing his belt, dropping trousers and squatting before he realizes -

He’s not alone -

Another soldier, British army shirt undone, sweating with the labour of burying a body. This is Gibson.
 

The other man notices Tommy, but barely pauses. Tommy finishes, pulls ups his trousers and moves towards him. Tommy helps stoop to tie over the body.

Tommy notices the corpe’s stockinged feet, then watches Gibson stoop to tie his boots...

Gibson looks up at him. Tommy shrugs, gestures for Gibson’s water can. Gibson hands it over and Tommy takes a swig, carefully catching drops in his hand, then licking them off his palm.

Tommy leaves Gibson buttoning his shirt and heads back onto the beach.

There are destroyers out on the water, too far to reach.

Tommy wanders down to join one of the long, snaking lines which extends into the sea, soldiers up to their chests in water, waiting patiently for ships which do not move.

The man at the back turns to Tommy, unwelcoming. Points at his own insignia.

MAN
Grenadiers, mate.

Tommy moves off. Looks around at other impossibly long lines, at the unattainable ships. Futile.

A line of stretcher-bearers comes past, carrying wounded men along the beach towards the harbour...

Looking where they’re headed, Tommy sees a long, narrow breakwater extending out into the sea, packed with soldiers. A hospital ship at the end of it.

This breakwater extends a kilometer into the sea. It is called the Mole.

Super title:

1.	THE MOLE one week
Tommy becomes aware of the sound of distant aircraft. Soldiers peer up into the sky...

MALE VOICE (O.S.) DIVE BOMBERS!
 

Tommy spots the distinctive kinked wings of the notorious Stuka dive bomber, its nightmarish howl rising as it picks up speed, diving at the beach...

The lines of men instantly vanish - soldiers scattering back to the dunes, burrowing into the sand... The first bombs lift sand into the air.

The stretcher-bearers put down their loads, lying across them, protecting them as the area is hammered...

The first Stuka pulls out of its dive, revealing two more Stukas diving. There are nine more about to follow...

Tommy sees a soldier lying on his back, rifle aimed at the sky, firing defiantly, desperately at the attacking plane... The ground around him lifts into the air with the second wave of bombs.

Tommy buries his face in the sand as the bombs blast and blast and blast -

The explosions stop. Tommy lifts his head. BOOM! Another wave of bombs explodes in series up the beach. Then, finally, quiet. Tommy rises...

The stretcher-bearers, back on their feet, lift their burdens (four bearers per stretcher, one at each corner).

Several stretchers are left behind on the sand.

Soldiers on the beach watch in despair as one of the destroyers is slipping below the water, smoke billowing.

MALE VOICE (CONT’D) WHERE’S THE BLOODY AIR FORCE?!

CUT TO:


EXT. ENGLISH COAST, WEYMOUTH HARBOUR - MORNING

A lanky youth runs down to the masts of the crowded harbour.

He races along the wooden dock, jumping over the ropes as he rushes to a large yacht, the Moonstone.

Super title:

2.	THE SEA one week
 

The youth, George (seventeen), leaps from the dock into the well. Two naval officers emerge from the cabin, pushing past. George watches them go, confused...

Mr. Dawson (fifties, civilian dress) hands George a stack of china plates and ducks back inside.

A second young man, Peter (nineteen), emerges, carrying boxes.

PETER
Navy’s requisitioned her - there’s some men across the Channel, at Dunkirk, need taking off.
(points at dock)
They told us to strip her and load those life jackets.

George looks along at the dock. At a pile of hundreds of life jackets. George looks at Peter. Surprised.

GEORGE
Some men?

PETER
Navy’ll be back in an hour. My dad wants to be ready before then...

CUT TO:


EXT. SKY - DAY

Moving through billowy peaks, three sleek, beautiful Spitfires streak into frame. Elegant. In confident formation.

Super title:

3.	THE AIR one hour

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

The pilot, Farrier, has a light touch on the controls. He checks his left and right, scanning the skies.

VOICE ON RADIO
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

Farrier reaches forward to his fuel gauge, pushes the button beside it - the needle shoots up to three-quarters full.
 

FARRIER
Seventy gallons.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

The pilot, Collins, checks his fuel gauge -

COLLINS
Sixty-eight gallons, Fortis Leader.

FORTIS LEADER
(over radio)
Stay down at five hundred feet to leave fuel for forty minutes fighting time over Dunkirk.

COLLINS
Understood. Vector 128, angels point five.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier checks his chart.

FORTIS LEADER
Keep an eye on that gauge, even when it gets lively - save enough to get back.

With a glance at his fuel gauge, Farrier pulls on the stick.


EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS

The three planes bank left in perfect harmony as we -

CUT TO:


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - LATE AFTERNOON

Tommy looks down at several patients on stretchers left behind bearers dead or disappeared...

One of them groans. Still alive. Tommy looks around. Gibson is there.
They grab the stretcher and hustle down the beach towards the mole...
 

EXT. BASE OF THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

A Warrant Officer tries to keep order as men line up to start the shuffle out along the eight-foot wide concrete mole.

The line of stretcher-bearers approaches...

From the base all you can see is the backs of helmeted heads queuing out onto the narrow breakwater.

The Warrant Officer sees the stretchers, waves them past -

WARRANT OFFICER
Along the mole. All the way, she’s leaving -

A ship’s whistle -

WARRANT OFFICER (CONT’D)
That’s it.
(he turns) MAKE WAY! MAKE WAY!

The stretcher-bearers squeeze past...


EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Tommy and Gibson hear the ship’s whistle. They start running with the stretcher, heading for the base of the mole...


EXT. BASE OF THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

The Warrant Officer addresses a group of French soldiers.

WARRANT OFFICER NO FRENCH! NON FRANÇAISES -
SEULEMENT ANGLAISES! ENGLISH ONLY, YOU’LL HAVE YOUR OWN SHIPS!

Tommy and Gibson arrive, panting. The Warrant Officer looks up at them. The ship’s whistle - the Warrant Officer points up -

WARRANT OFFICER (CONT’D)
That’s two minutes - you’ve missed it.

He turns back to arguing with the French...

Tommy pushes forward with the stretcher. Soldiers try to let him through on the narrow mole -
 

The Warrant Officer, seeing Tommy, just shakes his head.


EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS

Stretchers are loaded up the gangplank onto the deck of the ship, supervised by a Petty Officer.

He checks his watch, then looks along the mole at the remaining stretchers...


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Tommy weaves along the mole, squeezing past the mass of troops jamming the breakwater...

Tommy leans out over the edge where the rail is missing, a twenty-foot drop to the churning water...

Gibson follows, echoing Tommy’s route and footing.


EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS

The last of the line of stretchers is carefully, awkwardly raised up from the mole onto the deck of the ship. The Petty Officer speaks urgently to the last stretcher-bearer.

PETTY OFFICER
Last?

The Stretcher-Bearer nods, too breathless to speak, then follows his colleagues back down off the ship.

An explosion hits the water nearby -

Everyone hits the deck as shells impacts the water.


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Tommy is pulled up short as Gibson stumbles -

An ME 109 strafes the length of the mole with gunfire - soldiers hit the deck, several are hit...

Gibson struggles up.

CUT TO:
 

EXT. WEYMOUTH HARBOUR - DAY

Peter and George rush things off the boat, then start loading the orange life-preservers. Mr. Dawson looks up from his charts to see naval officers and crew coming along the harbour, assigning crew members to boats...

Peter follows his gaze -


INT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter bursts into the cabin, stacking life vests.


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

The pile of life vests on the dock shrinks... Mr. Dawson watches the naval men coming closer -

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier lightly brushes his fingers over the dashboard.

COLLINS
(over radio)
Dunkirk’s so far, why can’t they load at Calais?

Farrier looks over at his wing mate, Collins (Fortis 2).

FORTIS LEADER
(over radio)
The enemy had something to say about it.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins scans the skies above...

COLLINS
Down here we’re sitting ducks.

FORTIS LEADER
(over radio)
Keep ‘em peeled. They’ll come out of the sun.
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier looks around into the blinding sun...

CUT TO:


EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS

The Petty Officer barks orders at the crew -

PETTY OFFICER
Man the bow line! Ready on the stern!

Troops stuck down on the mole below look resentfully at the ship preparing to depart. One Soldier calls up -

SOLDIER
Any more room?

The Petty Officer glares down at him.


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Tommy breaks through a tight crowd of soldiers and stops.

In front of him is a jagged chasm. One narrow plank laid across it. The drop is fifteen feet to rocks and concrete below.

The ship’s whistle sounds. Tommy stares -

SOLDIER
Take a run at it!

Tommy glances at the Soldier who spoke. Looks back at Gibson.

TOMMY
One, two, three!

Tommy bolts across, pure concentration, the plank bowing and bouncing as he crosses the middle, Gibson following. Tommy’s foot slips, he almost goes over, rights himself -

Helpful arms grab them as they hit the other side, a couple of cheers from the crowd. Tommy ploughs on -
 

EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - CONTINUOUS

Tommy passes the stretcher-bearers coming back down the mole. One of them moves to help but Tommy shakes his head, pushing past.

The Petty Officer gestures at his men to pull the gangplanks -

PETTY OFFICER PULL THE GANGPLANKS!

Tommy and Gibson arrive at the end of the mole.

TOMMY
Oi!

A gangplank is shoved back down.

They struggle up it with the stretcher.

When they make it to the deck they practically drop their burden, gasping for breath. Orderlies takes the stretcher below.

Tommy and Gibson look around for a place to perch, catching their breaths...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Dawson sees the Naval Officers stepping onto their dock -

MR. DAWSON
Ready on the stern line.

George hops onto the dock, unties the stern line. Stops. Looks at the approaching Officers. Then back to Mr. Dawson -

GEORGE
Aren’t you waiting for the navy?

Mr. Dawson starts the engine. Peter jumps down onto the boat with the bow rope...

MR. DAWSON
They’ve asked for the Moonstone, they’ll have her. With her captain.

PETER
And his son.
 

The boat moves off. Peter looks to catch the line from George.

PETER (CONT’D)
Thanks for the help, George.

Who, instead, jumps onto the stern, to Peter’s surprise.

PETER (CONT’D)
You know where we’re going?

GEORGE
France.

MR. DAWSON
Into war, George.

GEORGE
I’ll be useful, sir.

Mr. Dawson looks at George. Pushes the throttle forward and they motor out of the harbour into the English Channel...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins spots something -


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY
Farrier spots the ME 109 coming out of the sun - FARRIER
Bandit - eight o’clock.

FORTIS LEADER
(over radio) Break.


EXT. SKY OVER ENGLISH CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

The three Spitfires dart away from each other. The German plane takes the left one (Collins), hurtling down -


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins dives, rolling, glancing back -
 

COLLINS
He’s on me!


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier banks around, lining up on Collins’ pursuer.

FARRIER
And I’m on him -

CUT TO:


EXT. HOSPITAL SHIP - EVENING

Tommy and Gibson shuffle around the deck, looking for a spot to settle...

The Able Seaman manning the gangplank calls over -

ABLE SEAMAN
You two, get a shift on!

Tommy reluctantly follows Gibson onto the plank.


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

As he shuffles down the gangplank he looks over at the thousands queuing on the mole...

A Second Lieutenant on the mole waves Tommy along -

SECOND LIEUTENANT
Off you two! Back up the line!

As Tommy steps off the plank he hears a noise: Gibson, finger to his lips, ‘shush’, is crouched in the crisscross structure below the mole where he can’t be seen by the officers on top. He beckons Tommy to join him...

PETTY OFFICER
That last barrage damaged the rudder!

The Second Lieutenant turns to the Petty Officer. Tommy slips down beside Gibson -

SECOND LIEUTENANT
Tie up again while we try to fix it.
 

They settle in on the beams just above the water line...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - MORNING

Mr. Dawson comes to the back of the well, fits the tiller, to steer from outside, Peter at his side. George, on the bow, looks across at several naval vessels on the same course.

Suddenly he spots a bomber overhead -

GEORGE
Mr. Dawson!

Mr. Dawson’s eyes don’t leave his course -

MR. DAWSON
One of ours, George.

George looks up at the plane. A Blenheim passes over.

Looking down to his left - a fishing trawler bobbing along. Further back down the convoy he sees a Thames paddle steamer.

A destroyer approaches from the opposite direction. As George peers, he starts to make out shapes of men on the decks.

The destroyer passes close enough that George can see the boat is packed with soldiers. Weary, bedraggled, dispirited soldiers. George stares at the haunted faces.

As the Moonstone rides over the wake of the destroyer, an ominous boom reverberates in the distance. Too sudden for thunder, the boom multiplies into a distant barrage...

Mr. Dawson comes forward, drawn by the sound. He stares at the horizon - distant black smoke precisely where they’re headed. More booms. Mr. Dawson looks at George. Who is scared. He puts his hand on his shoulder. Nods reassuringly.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier concentrates, trying to angle his plane at the tail of the ME 109 ahead... but the German plane keeps pulling out of his sights, turning right, pulling g’s, rolling...

FARRIER
On my mark - draw him left, Fortis 2... Three, two, one, mark -
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins pulls hard left, rolling up and left as tracer fire streaks past.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier watches the ME 109 cut left to follow Collins. He pushes the button on his stick to strafe the plane with his cannons... Smoke starts trailing from the German plane.

FARRIER
Clear.


EXT. SKY OVER ENGLISH CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

The ME 109 trails heavy smoke as it tips towards the water -


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins straightens out, tries to look back -

COLLINS
Is he down?


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier watches the ME 109 smash into the water, breaking up in a fiery mess -

FARRIER
Down for the count -

Tracer fire smashes into Farrier’s plane, sparking inside and out. Farrier banks hard right as a second 109 streaks away.
He straightens up.

 



Nothing.




Nothing.
 
FARRIER (CONT’D)
Fortis leader, one bandit down...



FARRIER (CONT’D)
Fortis leader, do you read?
 

Farrier looks around, spots a Spitfire -
 

FARRIER (CONT’D)
Fortis 2, I have you to port - no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

COLLINS
(over radio)
Understood, Fortis 1. Orbit for a look...

Farrier looks all around as he pulls right on the stick...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING

Eerie quiet.

Tommy and Gibson sit in the structure, unseen, listening...

Commander Bolton checks his progress on board the hospital ship.

COMMANDER BOLTON
How long, Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT
We need to run a new cable, sir. They’re scrambling.

Commander Bolton turns to Colonel Winnant, the army representative.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Colonel, you’re going to have to decide how many more wounded to evacuate... one stretcher takes the space of seven standing men.

Colonel Winnant takes this in.

Tommy crouches lower as he sees a launch approach...

A high-ranking officer is helped up the ladder onto the mole.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
(salutes) Rear Admiral.

REAR ADMIRAL
Commander.
(to Colonel Winnant) At ease, Colonel. How’s the perimeter?
 

Colonel Winnant gestures towards the smoke-shrouded town -

COLONEL WINNANT
Shrinking ever day. But between our rearguard and the French... we’re holding the line. And the enemy tanks I’ve stopped.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Why?

COLONEL WINNANT
Waste precious tanks, when you can pick us off from the air, like fish in a barrel?

COMMANDER BOLTON
How long does London expect the army to hold out before we make terms?

The Rear Admiral looks sharply at the idea.

REAR ADMIRAL
Make terms? They’re not stopping here. We need to get our army back.

The Rear Admiral points across the dark water...

REAR ADMIRAL (CONT’D)
Britain’s next. Then the world.

Commander Bolton puts his field glasses to his face.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Christ, you can almost see it from here...

 

What?


Home.
 
COLONEL WINNANT


COMMANDER BOLTON
 
(turns to town) What about the French?

REAR ADMIRAL
Publicly, Churchill’s told them
bras dessous.
(off look)
Arm in arm. Leaving together.

COLONEL WINNANT
And privately?
 

REAR ADMIRAL
We need our army back.

COLONEL WINNANT
How many men are they talking about?

REAR ADMIRAL
Churchill wants thirty thousand. Ramsay’s hoping we can give him forty-five.

Commander Bolton looks out at the mass of humanity.

COMMANDER BOLTON
There are four hundred thousand men on this beach, sir.

Down below, Tommy takes this in. Every man for himself.

REAR ADMIRAL
We’ll just have to do our best.

Bolton straightens up.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Right, this mole stays open at all costs.

Bolton points at the funnel and masts of sunken ships.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
We’re in range of artillery from the west - anything else sinks out here, the mole’s blocked and we’re stuffed.

REAR ADMIRAL
Can’t we load from the beaches?

COLONEL WINNANT
Better than standing out here when the dive bombers come.

COMMANDER BOLTON
Impossible.

The Rear Admiral looks at the lines of men on the beaches.

REAR ADMIRAL
Too shallow.
 

COMMANDER BOLTON
Anything drafting more than three feet can’t get near. We don’t have enough small boats to ferry men out to the destroyers.

The Rear Admiral nods.

REAR ADMIRAL
The mole it is, gentlemen.

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

Mr. Dawson is on the bow, peering ahead. The distant smoke is closer, small shapes in the sky move above distant ships, accompanied by thunderous booms...

Much nearer: a shape. A wreck. Upside down.

Mr. Dawson moves quickly down the yacht to the well and takes the helm, throttling back. He gestures for Peter to head to the bow.

The Moonstone approaches the wreck. Bodies surround the overturned hull.

Crouched on the hull - a soldier.

Mr. Dawson reverses the screw, slowing to a crawl. Peter stares out at the Shivering Soldier.

PETER
Can you swim?

The Shivering Soldier stares back at Peter. Peter looks back at Mr. Dawson.

PETER (CONT’D)
Can you get closer?

Mr. Dawson looks down the side of the boat, considers.

MR. DAWSON
Can’t risk it!

Mr. Dawson turns to George.

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Take Peter a line.
 

George grabs a coiled rope and heads up to the bow. Peter takes the rope from George -

PETER
I’ll throw you a line!

The Shivering Soldier looks up at him, blank. Peter tosses the line. It hits the water several feet in front of the soldier who stares at it.

Peter gathers the line, then tosses it again.

The Shivering Soldier springs for it, grabbing it and hanging on as Peter and George reel him in, pulling him around to the stern ladder.

He is too exhausted to make it up the ladder, so they grab his shirt, pulling him into the well.

George grabs a blanket and puts it around the Soldier’s shoulders.

Mr. Dawson glances at the Soldier, then reverses from the wreck the way they came in, and steers wide around the visible portion of the wreck.

Once the water ahead is open, Mr. Dawson speeds up, heading again for the dark smoke of Dunkirk.

CUT TO:


EXT. SKY ABOVE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

The two Spitfires arc around the wreckage of the ME 109...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier spots something -

FARRIER
Wreckage below.

He heads low over the wreckage.

COLLINS
(over radio) More of the 109?

Farrier banks, looking down, spots a half submerged tail - clearly RAF.
 

FARRIER
No, it’s Fortis Leader, over.

COLLINS
Do you think he got out?

FARRIER
Didn’t see a ‘chute.

Farrier straightens up. Considers.

FARRIER (CONT’D)
Record his position, then set heading 128, height... one thousand, over.

COLLINS
Vector 128, angels 1. Understood.

Farrier reaches forward, pushes the button by his fuel gauge... Nothing.

The glass is cracked. He taps it with his glove. Nothing.

FARRIER
Fortis 2, what’s your fuel?


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins checks his gauge.

COLLINS
Fifty gallons, over.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier takes this down with a grease pencil...

FARRIER
Keep letting me know - my gauge took a knock back there, over.

COLLINS
Should you turn back?

Farrier methodically checks his other gauge and switches... checks the responsiveness of rudder, ailerons...

FARRIER
I’m confident it’s just the gauge.
 

Farrier glances at his pencil mark, sets the bezel on his watch.

He taps his gauge one more time. Nothing.

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING

Bolton watches the Rear Admiral motor away in his launch, the engine noise fading to be replaced by -

A familiar, dreaded sound, building. Stukas. The men on the mole look up at the sky.
From high above we see how trapped and exposed this line of men stretching a kilometer into the sea really is.

Restless, the soldiers look behind and in front. There’s simply nowhere to go. The awful whine builds. Then changes pitch as the bombers go into their dive.

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM! The bombs impact the sea either side of the mole. Soldiers crouch as low as they can -

The onslaught is endless, terrible and inescapable. BOOM! A direct hit to the hospital ship -
The Stukas have gone.

Screams and shouts - people start jumping over the side of the hospital ship onto the mole...

VOICES
She’s going down! SHE’S GOING UNDER!

Commander Bolton shouts at the men manning the lines

COMMANDER BOLTON CUT HER LOOSE!

The crew are jumping off the side, the burning ship is sinking.

SUB-LIEUTENANT
What about the wounded?

COMMANDER BOLTON
Cut her loose, and push her off! We can’t let her sink at the mole!
 

The men cast her off and push her off. Crew members and orderlies leap from the deck into the water -

The bow is blazing, sinking ship drifts away from the mole. Tommy and Gibson pull soldiers up onto the beams of the mole.
As the bow comes around, the stern scrapes along the wooden pilings, splintering them in its path -

A flailing soldier is in its path, trying to swim free - The steel hull is about to crush him -
Tommy grabs him by the shoulders and yanks with all his might, pulling him clear just as the hull grinds against the wood. Tommy looks down on the breathless, wet soldier. The wet soldier focuses on Tommy.

This is Alex. He nods thanks. Tommy nods back.

Commander Bolton watches the ship slip down into the waves.

Mr. Dawson is back at the helm. The Shivering Soldier sits in the well, blanket over his shoulders. Staring at the deck.
George watches him, then leans forward.

GEORGE
Come below - it’s out of the wind.

The Shivering Soldier glances at the companionway. Shakes his head.

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Really - it’s warmer.

George reaches out for the Shivering Soldier’s arm - who smacks it away -

MR. DAWSON
Leave him, George.

George looks up at the Commander.

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
He feels safer on deck. You would too if you’d been bombed -
 

SHIVERING SOLDIER
U-boat. It was a U-boat.

Get him some tea, George.

George darts downstairs. Useful.

Farrier instinctively looks at his gauge. Nothing.

Farrier pulls out a grease pencil and notes fuel and time.

FARRIER (CONT’D)
We’re about five minutes out - climb to two thousand.

COLLINS

FARRIER
I don’t want to get jumped again. Get some altitude, dive down on the bastards. Over.

Commander Bolton looks over at the wet soldiers clinging to the understructure of the mole.

COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.)
Right, Highlanders. Let’s find you another ship.

The wet soldiers pull themselves to their feet...

Tommy, watched by Alex, slips into the water, then pulls himself out, dripping. Gibson follows suit. Alex laugh at them... then helps them push into the group.

They follow the wet soldiers up onto the mole, where Bolton’s men shepherd them onto a launch.


EXT. LAUNCH - CONTINUOUS

Tommy and Gibson make themselves inconspicuous among the Highlanders, eyes down.

As the launch pulls away from the mole, Tommy glances back at the men lining the breakwater.

The launch motors out of the harbour.

It approaches a destroyer, its sheer iron side towering above the launch, as it bobs up and down alongside.

Cargo nets are dropped over the side, and the men start to step up onto the rail of the bobbing ship, waiting for the rhythmic movement towards the iron wall, grabbing at the rope mesh, struggling to pull themselves up.

Tommy steps up to the railing, next to an exhausted soldier who can barely lift himself up. Tommy grabs his shoulder to steady on the rail as the launch bounces off the iron wall of the destroyer.

They both grab at the net, Tommy climbing up -
 

The exhausted soldier has not got his feet into the netting, he slips over...

The gap between the launch and the destroyer shrinks to nothing -

The soldier’s legs are crushed between the two oblivious crafts. He screams - hands pull him up as the craft separate...


EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

The men collapse onto the deck in exhausted piles. Sailors and Nurses urge them to move below decks.

SAILOR
Down below. Come on, mate -

Tommy follows Alex and his mates to a doorway at the head of the stairs down below. A Nurse is standing there.

NURSE
Come on, boys. There’s a nice cup of tea for you down there. This way, come on.


INT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

Tommy starts down the stairs. Gibson has stopped at the top, looking down into the stairwell.

NURSE
Come on, down you go - Gibson, shaking his head, steps back.
Alex sees this - turns to follow Tommy into the crowd in the hold. They are handed a cup of tea and a hunk of bread.

Out on deck, Gibson sits by the companionway in the gathering dark as the ship gets under way...

Down below, Tommy and Alex eat and drink hungrily and gratefully. Between bites, Alex gestures to the stairs.
 

ALEX
What’s wrong with your friend?

Tommy watches the door to the hold close. Takes another bite. Uneasy.

Looks around the hold, packed like the tube at rush hour.

Looking for a quick way out. In case we go down.

Tommy and Alex edge through the crowd towards the stairs...

Where are we going?

MR. DAWSON
Dunkirk.

SHIVERING SOLDIER
No, we’re going to England!

MR. DAWSON
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

SHIVERING SOLDIER I’M NOT GOING BACK!

Peter watches from the companionway. The Shivering Soldier throws his arm out of the dark cloud on the horizon -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
Look at it! We go there we’ll die!

Mr. Dawson looks at the Shivering Soldier. Calm.

MR. DAWSON
I see your point, son. Take your tea below and warm up while we plot a course.
 

The Shivering Soldier considers this. Then takes his blanket and heads down the companionway. Peter helps him down below.


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter opens the door to the forepeak and sits the Shivering Soldier down on a narrow bunk.

George looks up at the Commander. Addresses him with the tone of a child trying to speak like a grown-up...

GEORGE
Is he a coward?

Mr. Dawson looks sharply at George.

MR. DAWSON
He’s shell-shocked, George. He’s not himself. He may never be himself again.


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hands the Shivering Soldier a cup of tea. The Shivering Soldier accepts it wordlessly. Staring in front of him. Peter closes the forepeak door. Pauses.

Peter gently slides the bolt.

Spitfire 2 dives at the German fighters, cannons blasting... Spitfire 1 dives at the German bomber, cannons blasting...

Farrier has the Heinkel in his sights, bucking and weaving as his Spitfire slices down through turbulent air... He pushes the button on the stick which controls his guns...

He rolls away from the Heinkel as he dives beneath it, taking his finger off the trigger, fighting the g’s with his neck as he pulls out of the dive...

Collins fires at one of the 109s until he sees smoke trailing. He dives between the German planes...

Farrier scans his surroundings as he tries to orient himself relative to the Heinkel...

Finding it, he pulls the stick, lining up for another run at it, this time from below...

The bomber is in his sights - he fires his guns...
 

He flashes past, dangerously close to its top turret which hurls tracer bullets at him. He sees sparking on the hull of the bomber -


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Coming around, starting to climb, Collins sees the Heinkel veer off course, heading from the minesweeper -

COLLINS
She’s turning - you must’ve damaged her.

FARRIER

COLLINS
I got one of -

BLAM BLAM BLAM!! Cannon fire rips into Spitfire 2. Collins yanks the stick but it’s too late. Flames leap from the fuselage...

COLLINS (CONT’D)
I’m going down.

FARRIER

I’m on him - bail out.

Collins checks his parachute, opens the canopy. The wind howls inside the cockpit. He survey’s the water below - slides his canopy shut again.

Hello?! Anyone there?!

No. We have a job to do.

Mr. Dawson hears something, starts scanning the sky... Spots a distant plane... Peter follows his gaze.
Mr. Dawson throws the wheel, bearing to starboard, hard, throttling up.
 

MR. DAWSON
Heinkel.

Mr. Dawson points at a minesweeper heading towards them...

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
They’ll go for the minesweeper.

PETER
Shouldn’t we stand by? To pick up survivors?

MR. DAWSON
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

As the boat motors away, Peter looks back to see the Heinkel and its two fighters moving towards the minesweeper...

CUT TO:


EXT. GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

The Highlanders approach, cautiously. The beach is deserted here - just disabled army vehicles and dead bodies...

The blue trawler is tilted towards them. They circle the hull, checking it... it seems sound enough.

Tommy and Gibson follow the Highlanders as they climb up onto the abandoned trawler...


EXT. DECK OF GROUNDED TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Tommy looks over at the dunes above them. Alex looks around the boat, turns to Highlander 1.

ALEX
Where’s the crew?

HIGHLANDER 1
Probably got spooked after they ran aground. Scarpered up the beach.

ALEX
Why?

HIGHLANDER 2
We’re outside the perimeter. Enemy could be right there -
(points at the dunes) (MORE)
 
HIGHLANDER 2 (CONT'D)
Best shut ourselves inside and wait for the high tide...

Highlanders heads down the companionway into the small hold.

ALEX
How long’s that?

HIGHLANDER 3
Every three hours.

They descend into the hold, shutting the door behind them.

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

As the Moonstone ploughs through the swell, Peter looks back at the Heinkel coming over the minesweeper...

Peter spots -

PETER
Spitfire! Dad, Spitfire!

Mr. Dawson turns to see two Spitfires diving at the German bomber and its fighter escort. One Spitfire dives right between two 109s, setting one alight.

PETER (CONT’D)
He got him, he got him!!

The other Spitfire flies close over the Heinkel, which turns away from the ship. Mr. Dawson eases back on the speed...

MR. DAWSON
The Heinkel’s moved off...

As they watch, one of the Spitfires starts smoking...

PETER
Oh no...

Mr. Dawson sees the smoke, throws the wheel, spinning the yacht around to head back -

MR. DAWSON
Watch for a parachute!

Mr. Dawson throttles up...

CUT TO:
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farriers hears his engine skip a beat, puts his gloved finger on the reserve tank toggle switch, listening... His engine evens out again. He puts his hand back on the stick, focusing on the German planes...

He throttles up, speeding into the fray, climbing...

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Dimly lit by a couple of small, dirty portholes.

The soldiers lie around the hold. Sleeping or chatting. Alex is scrounging around the hold, finding nothing useful.

ALEX
(to Gibson)
Poke your head out, see if the water comes in.

Gibson shakes his head, pulling his arms tight around himself. Alex glares at him -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Talkative sod.

Tommy gets up, climbs up to the door, cracks it. Crawls up into the well - peeks over the rail -

The boat is in inches of water.

TOMMY
Bugger. Barely come in at all.

ALEX
For fuck’s sake.

HIGHLANDER 3
Calm down. What goes out comes back in, right?

ALEX
Yeah, but how long?

Silence answers this. Clearly no sailors aboard.

CUT TO:
 

EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

The Moonstone pushes through the swell, full speed, diesel engine straining...

Peter watches the smoke-trailing Spitfire fly lower and lower...

PETER
No parachute...

Mr. Dawson is watching the plane like a hawk, steering around the waves by instinct...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

The water flashes by blindingly fast...

Collins pulls back on the stick, raising the nose as the plane -

Hits the water with a jolt and a tearing sound. Collins trashed against his belts, forward/back/left/right -

Bang -


EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter watches the Spitfire ‘land’ on the surface of the water -

PETER
He’s down.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

With a shooosh, the plane is floating over the swell, like a sprinter hearing the gun. Collins releases his belts, starts inflating his life vest, pulls the catch on the canopy, yanking it back along its track. It jams... He thrusts his hand through the gap, struggling... From outside it looks like he is waving...

He looks up to see Farrier’s Spitfire shoot over, dipping a swing in salute...

Collins sits in the gently bobbing plane, collecting himself as he watches the water start to rise around the slowly sinking plane.

Collins tries the canopy again -
 

Jammed.

He is trapped in the sinking plane...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier levels off, looking down at the Heinkel approaching -

It has a single fighter escort - an ME 109 off the port wing...

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Tommy jolts awake - there are steps outside. He moves up to the door. Highlander 1 gets his rifle, moves in front of the door. Aims. Nods at Tommy...

Tommy throws open the door. A Seaman stands there -

SEAMAN
Nee, nee!

Highlander 1 is confused.

Tommy grabs the Seaman, pulling him down into the hold. Highlander 1 holds his gun on him -

ALEX
Kraut?

The Seaman looks uncomprehendingly up at Alex -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Are you German?!

SEAMAN
Dutch! Dutch! Merchant navy. Here to pick you up. To help you.

They sit him up.

ALEX
Why’d you leave your boat?

SEAMAN
In case German come. We wait up the beach with the soldiers. Wait for the tide.
 

HIGHLANDER 2
You came back, the tide must be in.

SEAMAN
Coming, yes. But more hours till we float.

ALEX
Hours?! Why’d you come back?

The Seaman gestures around the packet hold -

SEAMAN
Not so heavy when I left!

Alex and the others take this in.

A gunshot penetrates the hull - everybody lies flat, Tommy stares at the bullet hole, which lets in light...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

Mr. Dawson pushes the boat towards where the plane went down.

PETER
There was no ‘chute, dad...

Mr. Dawson ignores him. The engine is screaming...

PETER (CONT’D)
Dad, there was no ‘chute. He’s probably dead -

MR. DAWSON
(snaps)
Damn it, he might be alive!! Peter is shocked at his dad’s outburst.
Mr. Dawson stares at where the plane went down...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier lines up for his attack... Sighting the Heinkel as it commits to its bombing run over the destroyer, Farrier pushes forward on his stick, going into his dive...

CUT TO:
 

INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Everybody stares at the bullet hole, not making a sound... Another shot punches a hole two feet from the first -
Highlanders near the holes ease away, squeezing up against the other soldiers...

BANG! A third shot, directly above the first...

Two Highlanders grab their rifles, going for the stairs -

TOMMY
No! Then they’ll know we’re in here.

HIGHLANDER 1
Why else are they shooting at us?!

TOMMY
Look at the grouping...

Everybody looks at the three bullet holes.

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Target practice.

BANG! A fourth hole, near the others...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

The Moonstone is getting closer to the Spitfire bobbing on the waves.

Close enough to see that it is sinking...

MR. DAWSON
Peter, go forward with the boat hook.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS

Collins smashes the canopy back and forth on its track... Jammed, jammed, jammed.

Water starts pouring in, streaming through the gap in the half-open canopy. He shuts it... Trapped... Opens it, yanking, water pouring in...
 

Collins searches around looking for inspiration, for an implement, for anything -

Water rising past his ankles... his calves...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier dives, plummeting towards the Heinkel...

He glances across at the 109, which suddenly banks towards him, clearly reacting to Farrier’s attack...


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

As the men stare at the bullet holes, water starts slopping through the lowest ones... A Highlander goes to plug the holes.

BANG! The Highlander screams, clutching his face. His comrades pull him back, trying to smother his cries...

The water pours in steadily through the lowest holes. Alex points at the target zone -

ALEX
We have to plug it!

HIGHLANDER 1
After you, mate!

They stay back from the holes, wary. Watching the water pour in...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins pulls the steel flare gun from its holder. Water is coming up over his legs now... he smashes the flare gun into the canopy, again and again...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier fires at the Heinkel. Tracers zipping at the bomber. The 109 rises at him, guns blazing. Farrier rolls away, trying to dodge the fire -
 

EXT. SKY ABOVE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

As Spitfire 1 rolls way, the Heinkel releases its load - bombs falling around the destroyer -

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

A burst of machine guns fire opens a new group of holes beside the first -

Alex watches the water spraying in. He turns to the Dutch Seaman -

ALEX
How do we get off?! Do we need to ditch some ballast?!

The Dutch Seaman looks at him, uncomprehending -

ALEX (CONT’D)
Weight! Do we need to lose weight!

The Dutch Seaman shrugs.

SEAMAN
Weight, yes.

Alex turns to face the group -

ALEX
Somebody needs to get off.

HIGHLANDER 1
Well volunteered.

ALEX
We don’t need a volunteer. I know someone who ought to get off...

Alex turns to Tommy and Gibson. Points at Gibson.

ALEX (CONT’D)
This one. He’s a German spy.

TOMMY
Don’t be daft.

Alex stares Gibson down...
 

ALEX
He’s bloody Jerry. You might not’ve noticed that he hasn’t said a word, but I have. He doesn’t speak English - or if he does it’s with an accent thicker than sauerkraut sauce -

TOMMY
You’re daft. Tell him.

Gibson just stares at Alex...

ALEX
Yeah, tell me.

Nothing. Just the sound of water spraying in hard, jetting in through the bottom holes...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins smacks the canopy. The flare gun bounces off. He drops the flare gun, scrambles to find it under the water. The water is rising up his chest...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier cuts right, dodging away from the 109 -

Banking hard, he gets a clear look at the destroyer weathering the explosions.

A plume of water right next to the destroyer comes so high he flies through the top of its spray.

CUT TO:


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Alex turns to Highlander 1, holds out his hand for his gun. Highlander 1 hands it over. Alex moves to Gibson, pointing the rifle, hooks the barrel on Gibson’s tags, pulling them closer to read -

ALEX
Tell me... Gibson!
 

Tommy looks at Gibson, panicking -

TOMMY
Tell him, for God’s sake!

Alex pushes the rifle against Gibson’s cheek. Gibson cracks -

GIBSON
FRANÇAIS! JE SUIS FRANÇAIS!

Tommy stares, shocked. Alex moves back slightly, taking this in.

A burst of machine-gun fire. Everyone ducks from ricochets.

ALEX
A Frog. A bloody Frog. A cowardly little queue-jumping Frog...
With the end of his rifle Alex shakes Gibson’s tags - ALEX (CONT’D)
Who’s Gibson, eh? A naked dead Englishman lying out on that sand. Or did you at least have the decency to bury him?

“Gibson” just stares.

TOMMY
He did. I helped him. I thought it was his mate.

ALEX
Maybe he killed him -

TOMMY
He didn’t kill him -

ALEX
How do we know?!

TOMMY
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman on Dunkirk beach, for God’s sake?! He didn’t kill anyone - he was looking for a way off the damned sand like the rest of us!

The water is spraying in from more and more holes as the water level rises...

Alex has the rifle on Gibson. Another burst of machine-gun fire.
 

HIGHLANDER 2
Hadn’t they had enough practice by now?!

HIGHLANDER 1
They’re making sure she won’t float.

Highlander 2 looks at the holes spraying water, the water is pooling in the bottom of the hold. He turns to the Seaman -

HIGHLANDER 2
Will she still float?! The Seaman assesses the leaks...
SEAMAN
Float, yes. With less weight, yes -

ALEX
And we know who’s getting off -

TOMMY
You can’t do that. We’re on the same side.

Alex nudges Gibson with the rifle -

ALEX
Go on, up you go -

TOMMY
As soon as he pokes his head out they’ll slaughter him.

ALEX
Better him than me -

TOMMY
It’s not fair -

ALEX
Survival’s not fair.

HIGHLANDER 1
No, it’s shit. It’s fear and greed. Fate squeezed through the bowels of men. Shit.

TOMMY
He saved our lives.
 

HIGHLANDER 2
And he’s about to do it again - Go on -

Alex starts shoving Gibson up the stairs.

TOMMY
No! Just stop!

Alex turns to Tommy, looks him in the eye -

ALEX
We need someone to get off so the rest of us can live - You want to volunteer?

TOMMY
Fuck no. I’m going home.

ALEX
And if this is the price?

TOMMY
I’ll live with it, but it’s wrong.

Alex shoves Gibson up another step, opens the door -

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Alex, one man’s not going to make enough difference -

HIGHLANDER 1
You’d best hope it does, cos you’d be volunteering next -

TOMMY
What?

ALEX
(indicate Highlanders) We’re regimental brothers, mate. Just the way it is.

Gibson grabs for the rifle. Tommy jumps at Alex to help Gibson. They smash against the hull - as they drop into the water, the ship levels -

SEAMAN FLOAT! WE FLOAT!

HIGHLANDER 2 START THE BLOODY ENGINE!

The Seaman is already crawling out the hatch, reaching up -
 

The engine starts, loud as loud can be -

Machine-gun fire strafes the hull. The men duck below the waterline...

The Seaman throws the screw into reverse, full throttle...

The men hold their breaths under the water at the bottom of the hold as bullets pepper the hull...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - DAY

Collins, water up ti his ears now, grabs the flare gun - swinging underwater less effective.

Now he panics, pushing his face up against the canopy, banging with his fists, instinct taking over, no more thought, no more plan - banging, banging, water rising over his ears. Smash - something cracks into the canopy right above his head. He recoils. It impacts the canopy again, smashing the hole -

It is a boat hook...

Collins pulls himself through the hole, elbow first, forcing himself through, pushing off his seat, underwater, he pushes up from the sinking plane...


EXT. WATER, JUST OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Collins breaks the surface, gasping, looks around -

A private yacht with a young man on the bow, boat hook extended...

Collins grasps the boat hook.

COLLINS
(breathless) Afternoon.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier comes around again, searching the sky for the German planes...
 

He looks down at the destroyer. It is leaking oil from a large hole in its side...

The dark oil slick spreads quickly across the water, covering the men in the water between the trawler and the destroyer...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

The destroyer Basilisk casts off. Men cover every available piece of deck.

Commander Bolton watches her wake. Colonel Winnant approaches -

COLONEL WINNANT
We’ve wasted the day, Commander.

COMMANDER BOLTON
I share your frustration, Colonel.

They hear distant shots -

Commander Bolton raises his field glasses... He sees a blue trawler stuck in the shallows miles down the beach.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

Colonel Winnant takes the field glasses...

COLONEL WINNANT
The enemy’s breaking through the dunes to the east. This is it.


INT. HOLD, GROUNDED TRAWLER - DAY

Tommy comes up for air, gasping, spluttering...

Water is pouring in from dozens and dozens of holes... Alex comes up, coughing, with Gibson...
ALEX
We’re off!

Alex crawls over to the stairs, climbs out into the well -
 

EXT. TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Alex pokes his head out as the Seaman is sneaking up to see where they are headed -

The Dutch Seaman turns the wheel, jumps back onto the floor of the well as bullets impact the cabin. He throws the engine into forward gear, turns to Alex -

DUTCH SEAMAN THE HOLES! PLUG THE HOLES!

Alex crawls back downstairs -


INT. HOLD, TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Alex falls down the stairs -

ALEX
PLUG THE HOLES! PLUG THE HOLES!

The men stuff rags, bolts, fingers, anything they can lay hands on to plug as many holes as possible...

CUT TO:


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

Collins, drying himself with a blanket, looks down at George, whose breathing is shallow, sightless eyes open.

COLLINS
(to Peter)
I don’t really know, son. You were right not to move him.
(reassuring)
You’ve done the best for him you can.


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

The Shivering Soldier watches Collins come out on deck -

SHIVERING SOLDIER
Is he alright?

PETER (O.S.)
No.

Peter is glaring at the Shivering Soldier.
 

PETER (CONT’D)
No, he’s not -

BOOM! Collins follows Mr. Dawson’s gaze to a destroyer up ahead being bombed by a Heinkel, huge plumes of water rising just beside her.

The Shivering Soldier retreats into himself. Peter runs up to the bow -

A blue fishing trawler a quarter of a mile off, sinking...

PETER (CONT’D)
Dad, there’s men in the water!

Mr. Dawson looks ahead to where Peter is pointing. He puts the throttle forward, heading into the fray...

Collins spots Spitfire 1 arcing around, trying to get a bead on the Heinkel...

COLLINS
Come on, Farrier...

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier pulls on the stick, lining up behind a 109...

He fires, chasing down the plane, firing again... Smoke from the German plane, which starts to drop...

Farrier is in a heavy dive, when his engine chokes.

Farrier’s hand darts forward, switching to his reserve tank before the engine can die...

The engine catches again. Farrier pulls out of the dive...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

Through the binoculars Colonel Winnant watches the blue trawler pushing out to the sea, low in the water...

Commander Bolton watches a destroyer, under full steam, heading out to the Channel...

Where there are shapes of boats on the horizon...
 

EXT. DECK OF TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

The Dutch Seaman aims the boat at a destroyer out at the mouth of the harbour...


EXT. HOLD, TRAWLER - DAY

Tommy, Gibson, Alex, Highlander 1 and the others stuff the holes as best they can. The makeshift plugs pop out every few seconds - the soldiers scrabble under water to find them and stuff them back in, hands pressed against water jets, spray coming in everywhere...


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Omitted.*

* In previous drafts of the script, this is the point at which Bolton and Winnant first see the Little Ships. Ultimately in the cutting room, they returned the entrance
of the Little Ships to this location in the film.


EXT. DECK OF TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

The Dutch Seaman looks over the rail, concerned, to see how fast his boat is lowering into the swell...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

Collins watches Farrier spin around to get after the Heinkel.

The Moonstone comes up on the men in the water. Collins comes to the side, to help Peter fish men out, notices the surface of the water -

COLLINS
(to Mr. Dawson)
Oil. We’re getting into oil!

Mr. Dawson puts the screw into reverse, stopping the boat.

They fish men out of the water - the men covered in oil, anonymous in their glossy black filth...

CUT TO:
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier chases down the Heinkel, closing in as its top turret opens up on him, tracer fire lighting up all around him -

He dives down under the range of the rear turret, then angles up, firing at the bomber’s tail...

CUT TO:


EXT. BLUE TRAWLER - DAY

The Dutch Seaman sees water sloshing over the deck.

DUTCH SEAMAN ABANDON SHIP! ABANDON SHIP!


INT. HOLD, TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers, holding back the water, cannot hear him... One by one they start to abandon the task. More and more water pouring in... Alex and Gibson are last - Alex turns, sees they are alone, grabs Gibson by the shoulder then jumps for the exit. Gibson, still holding back the water, notices too late -


EXT. BLUE TRAWLER 0 C

Tommy gets on deck, sees the Keith, a quarter of a mile away. He dives into the water, pulling away from the swamped trawler -

All the men dive off the sinking boat, swimming for the Keith.


INT. HOLD, TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS

Gibson dives for the exit. He is blasted back by water, dragged down with the sinking trawler...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

Peter, Collins and the first oil-covered men pull more oily men from the water, the decks of the yacht rapidly filling. Mt. Dawson looks at the oil slick, concerned. He addresses the oily survivors -
 

MR. DAWSON
Below deck.

OILY SURVIVOR
No fear.

MR. DAWSON
We need to get as many of you on board as we can before the oil catches fire. Get below or get off my boat - your choice.

The oily survivors head below decks. Peter runs back to the companionway to shout down -

PETER
Careful there!


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Peter pokes his head down, sees two oily survivors moving George from the bottom of the steps =

PETER
Careful!

The oily survivors look up at him. Alex is one of them -

ALEX
(quiet) He’s dead, mate.

Peter takes this in...

PETER
So be bloody careful with him!


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Commander Bolton stares at the shapes in the distance...

He grabs the field glasses from Colonel Winnant, puts them to his eyes -

Boats. Civilian boats. All shapes and sizes. An armada. Colonel Winnant peers over Commander Bolton’s shoulder...
COLONEL WINNANT
What can you see?

Commander Bolton slowly lowers the glasses.
 

COMMANDER BOLTON
(gentle) Home.

Colonel Winnant grabs the glasses, confused...


EXT. DECK OF DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers peer over the railing at the absurd collection of vessels passing them in the opposite direction:

Yacht, paddle steamers, fishing trawlers, day sailors, ferries, dredgers, dinghies, row boats...

Crewed by:

Fisherman, merchant navy sailors, naval officers, civilian crew, naval crew, nurses, retired sailors...

The exhausted soldiers lining the decks of the Basilisk start to clap, then to cheer... Some are crying...


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Peter steps out of the cabin, reeling. Meets his dad’s questioning glance with unmistakable shock -

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.)
The lad...

Peter turns. The Shivering Soldier is looking up at him with terrified eyes, blanket tight around his shoulders.

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Will he be okay?

Peter looks at the Shivering Soldier. Sees the white knuckles clasping the edge of the rough blanket. Peter nods.

The Shivering Soldier turns, staring out at the destroyer. Peter catches Mr. Dawson looking at him. Approving.
Collins, pulling a man from the water, looks up at the Spitfire 1 chasing down the Heinkel -

COLLINS
Come on, Farrier...

CUT TO:
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier strafes the Heinkel - no apparent effect. Zipping over it, he dives down out of range of its turret, banks hard left to line up another shot. A 109 cuts across him, Tracer fire shooting past.

CUT TO:


EXT. WATER, JUST OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

Tommy swims for the Keith...

He hears an airplane... looks up to see a Heinkel coming in over the Keith... The bombs drop, plumes of water shoot upwards all around the ship. Tommy dives under the water for protection. The explosions are deafening - he holds his ears with his hands -

Tommy breaks the surface. The barrage is over, the Keith is still afloat. Tommy swims for it. Getting closer, Tommy realizes he’s swimming oil, the black sludge covering his head and arms. He looks back - the blue trawler is gently slipping beneath the water...

Tommy makes for the Keith, even as he sees men jumping into the water from her decks, lifeboats being lowered...

Tommy spots another craft - a yacht heading towards them. Tommy pulls for the yacht as hard as he can...

CUT TO:


EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS

The rag-tag collection of small ships works the beach, picking men up in the shallows, ferrying them out to bigger ships...

Small open boats use the truck ‘pier’ to load men as the Engineer looks on with pride...


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - DAY

The Moonstone is filled with oil-covered men, throughout the hold and across the decks - many more still in the water.

The Keith lists, men jump off the far side, away from the oil slick, where small ships are gathering to pick them up...
 

Collins moves up the side, watching Farrier bank hard to get behind the Heinkel. A 109 zips across his path, guns blazing...

Collins looks down at the oil-covered water...


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier pulls around, hard. The Heinkel is in front of him, side on, heading in for another run at the Keith.

Farrier banks and pulls up to keep the bomber in his sights as he fires his cannons -

The Heinkel catches fire and starts falling...


EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Collins sees the heinkel catch fire - turns to Mr. Dawson.

COLLINS        GO! GO! GO!

Mr. Dawson throws the engine into gear, turns the wheel - The Heinkel falls flaming towards the oil slick...
Peter has hold of one last oil-covered survivor, who hangs on for dear life as the boat drags him through the oily water -

The men left in the water shout with despair as the Moonstone motors away -

The flaming Heinkel hits the water - explodes -

The surface of the water catches fire, spreading across the water. Men duck underwater to escape the flames.

Underwater: Highlander 1 pushes down under, looking up at the fire. The surface is aflame as far as he can see...

Peter holds on to the oil-covered soldier -

Who is now being washed with cleaner water as they come out of the slick. As the oil comes off his face we see that it is Tommy...

Collins watches, appalled, as the men in the water are engulfed by relentless flames... The Keith is going down - survivors on the far side are picked up by the various small ships...
 

Under the water, Highlander 1’s air runs out. The flames rage above...

His instinct to breath pushes him up into the flames where he is engulfed, screaming, dying -

Tommy lies on the deck at Peter’s feet, eyes closed...

TOMMY
(a whisper) Take me home.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier sees the Heinkel explode, turns away towards the beaches...

He looks down at -

The thousands of men on the beach.

The small ships ferrying out to the larger vessels. The narrow mole with its endless rope of men...
Farrier is awestruck...

He hears his engine starts to sputter... It dies and the prop stops...

EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

Commander Bolton watches with satisfaction as a paddle steamer ties up. He calls up to a Stewardess (fifty-nine) -

COMMANDER BOLTON
Where’s you from?

STEWARDESS
Out of Dartmouth!

Bolton shakes his head in joyous disbelief. He watches men load into a small open sailboat crewed by two young men.

COMMANDER BOLTON
From Deal?

They nod.
 

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
Mind the current at the mouth, boys.

Bolton spots Spitfire 1. It soars overhead. He waves -

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Where’ve you all been all my life?!

Commander Bolton sighs at this... then notices. No engine noise.

He watches the Spitfire, concerned, until -

Hears something - another engine... A high whine... He turns to see -

A Stuka...

The men lining the mole shift restlessly. Trapped...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

The Moonstone chugs along, low in the water, men laying down along her decks...


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Men lie on every available space, packed in like sardines. Tommy catches sight of Alex looking at him. Tommy nods.


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Dawson is at the helm. Collins hears a distant engine -

COLLINS
That’s a fighter -

MR. DAWSON
ME 109, from the South. Peter, take the wheel, listen for my instructions.

Mr. Dawson steps up onto the seat to look above the roof of the cabin...

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Point her south.
 

Peter turns the wheel, the Moonstone swings to port, straightens up. Mr. Dawson spots the 109, closing...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

Commander Bolton turns to see the Stuka approaching, its distinctively kinked-wing silhouette bearing down like an awful bird of prey...

The soldiers stir, some crouching, some closing their eyes. Commander Bolton takes a knee, bracing. He bites his lip as the Stuka goes into its dive, that terrible whine building...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

Mr. Dawson stares at the approaching 109-

MR. DAWSON
Full speed ahead.

Peter throttles up -

The 109 is growing close now...

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
Get ready to pull hard to port... before he fires he’ll have to lower his nose, I’ll give you the signal...

Peter reaches over to the side of the wheel, ready to throw it. The 109 is practically upon them...

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - DAY

Commander Bolton is mumbling a prayer as he watches the Stuka come at them -

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!!

The Stuka is strafed with fire as Spitfire 1 flashes past -
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier darts past the Stuka, gliding, guns blazing...


EXT. THE MOLE - CONTINUOUS

The Stuka never fires, it just smashes into the sea... The soldiers all along the mole cheer.


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier watches the Stuka disintegrate on the surface of the water. He nods... feeling the unaccustomed silence...

CUT TO:


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

Mr. Dawson stares at the approaching 109. Peter glances back and forth between the 109 and his father...

MR. DAWSON
Wait for it... wait till he’s committed to his line...

The nose of the 109 dips down -

MR. DAWSON (CONT’D)
NOW!

Peter throws the wheel, the Moonstone lurches to port -

The guns on the 109 light up, strafing the water to starboard
-

The 109 flashes over... Collins watches it recede.

COLLINS
He’s off.

MR. DAWSON
Bigger fish to fry.

Collins looks at Mr. Dawson. Curious.

COLLINS
How’d you know all that, anyway?

Mr. Dawson steps onto the deck.
 

MR. DAWSON
My son’s one of you lot. I knew he’d see us through.

Mr. Dawson moves forward. Collins steps up beside Peter.

COLLINS
You’re RAF?

MR. DAWSON
Not me. My brother. Flew Hurricanes. He died third week into the war.

Collins looks forward at the proud father standing by the mast.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier sits in the silence, gliding... looking to see how far he might make it up the beach...

CUT TO:


INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - EVENING

Tommy gets to his feet, steps over other men as he slips over to the stairs...


EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - EVENING

Tommy and Alex poke their heads out -

PETER
Stay below, please.

TOMMY
We just want to see the cliffs -

Tommy looks over at white cliffs, ghostly above the dark water.

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Dover?

Peter shakes his head, amused.

PETER
Weymouth.
 

Alex shakes his head, sadly.

ALEX
We let you all down, didn’t we?

Peter just looks at this exhausted, ragged boy his own age.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier glides, banking, looking for a suitable stretch of beach to ditch...

In the strangely silent plane, he passes over the troops, lines up on the vast stretch of sand beyond Malo Les Bains...

CUT TO:


EXT. HARBOUR AT WEYMOUTH - NIGHT

Soldier after soldier climbs out of the yacht. The Corporal handing out travel chits marvels at the absurd amount...

CORPORAL
How many you got in there?

The Shivering Soldier is taken ashore, wrapped in blankets.

Tommy and Alex stick together as they are handed hot cups of tea and shepherded out of the harbour in long lines.

Peter supervises as George’s body is taken ashore.

As Collins steps off the boat a soldier from another boat spots his RAF uniform -

SOLDIER
(furious)
Where the hell were you!

Collins just stands there. He feels a hand on his shoulder. It is Mr. Dawson. He indicates the men filing off the Moonstone -

MR. DAWSON
They know here you were.

Mr. Dawson puts his hat on. To go home.
 

EXT. WEYMOUTH RAIL YARD - NIGHT

Tommy and Alex, exhausted, downcast, are herded across the tracks towards a train. Before getting on they are handed a blanket and cup of tea by an Elderly Man, who looks at their hands, not their faces, as he hands the rough blankets over -

ELDERLY MAN
Well done, lads... well done, lads...

ALEX
All we did is survive.

ELDERLY MAN
That’s enough. Well, done, lads, well done, lads...

Alex steps up onto the train. The Elderly Man reaches out to Tommy, touching his face - clearly blind.


INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

Tommy flops down, lying across the seat. Alex is slumped opposite, tears starting to roll down his cheeks.

ALEX
That old bloke wouldn’t even look us in the eye.

No response. He looks over. Tommy is already asleep.

CUT TO:


EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING

The mole is empty but for bodies.

A Private opens his eyes. He sits up, alone on the deserted mole, his comrades gone, mistaken for dead...

COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.)
Come on, then, Private...

The Private looks down at the water to see Commander Bolton standing in a launch full of army officers.

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT’D)
I know we’re officers, but it’s us or the enemy, so now’s not the time to be particular...
 

The Private scrambles down into the launch, where Colonel Winnant stands talking to Commander Bolton.

They look out at the vast deserted beach, littered with corpses and abandoned equipment...

COLONEL WINNANT
(to Commander Bolton) Churchill got his thirty thousand.

COMMANDER BOLTON
And then some. Almost three hundred thousand. So far.

Commander Bolton steps back up onto the mole.

COLONEL WINNANT
So far?

COMMANDER BOLTON
I’m staying.
(off look) For the French.

The launch pulls away from Commander Bolton on the mole.

CUT TO:


INT. TRAIN - MORNING

Sunlight flickering on Tommy’s eyelids wakes him. We have the sense that he has been asleep for a very long time.

The train full of soldiers rolls to a halt. Alex opens the window, spots a Boy near the tracks -

ALEX
Hey! Where are we?!

BOY
Siding. You’ll put in in a minute -

ALEX
What station?

BOY
(surprised) Woking.

Alex spots stacks of newspapers waiting to be loaded.

ALEX
Grab me one of them papers.
 

 
The Boy hesitates.


Go on!
 


ALEX (CONT’D)
 

The Boy pulls the paper off the top and stretches up to hand it to Alex. Alex slumps into his seat. The headline:

CHURCHILL ADDRESSES DUNKIRK EVACUATION IN COMMONS

Alex thrusts the paper at Tommy.

ALEX (CONT’D)
I can’t bear it. You read it.

TOMMY
Can’t bear it?

ALEX
They’ll be spitting at us in the streets. If they’re not locked up waiting for the invasion.

CUT TO:


EXT. WEYMOUTH TOWN - DAY

Peter walks down the deserted high street. He stops. Walks into the office of the local paper, the Herald...


INT. HERALD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Peter hands the Editor a photograph. Of George.

CUT TO:


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Farrier checks his canopy is locked, stows loose items, pumping the handle all the while...


EXT. SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

The landing gear inches out of its housing...

CUT TO:
 

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Tommy looks down at the paper. Starts to read. Poorly.

TOMMY
“Wars are not won by evacuations.” Alex shakes his head at this.
The train starts to pull into the station...

The platforms is crowded with civilians. Alex slinks down into his seat, turning away from the window...

A Civilian bangs on the glass, peering in...

ALEX
I can’t look,

TOMMY
“But there was a victory inside this deliverance which should be noted...”

Alex turns. The Civilian grins, holding up two beer bottles. The platform is packed with cheering and waving civilians...

Women with sandwiches and drinks rush up to the windows...

TOMMY (CONT’D)
“Our thankfulness at the escape of our army -”

Alex opens the window , grabbing food and drink as Tommy continues to read...

TOMMY (CONT’D)
“- Must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France... is a colossal military disaster...”


INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

Farrier pumps the handle -


EXT. SPITFIRE - CONTINUOUS

The landing gear inches past halfway down...
 

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS

Pumping the handle, Farrier checks his belts -

TOMMY (V.O.)
“And we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately...”

Farrier holds the plane steady in its descent towards the sands...


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - CONTINUOUS

Spitfire 1 swoops onto the flat sand, wheels down.

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France...”

Farrier slides back the canopy and climbs out of the plan...


INT. MR. DAWSON’S HOME - DAY

Peter, gets up from the kitchen. Mrs. Dawson is at the stove, her back to us.

As Peter grabs his coat he runs into Mr. Dawson, letters in hand, looking at the Herald. He hands it to Peter...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight on the seas and oceans...”

The small headline:


LOCAL BOY, GEORGE MILLS, JUST 17, HERO AT DUNKIRK

Peter looks at his father. Nods with satisfaction.


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - DAY

Farrier brushes sand from the wing of his beloved Spitfire...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air...”

Farrier pulls his flare gun... He shoots into the cockpit...
 

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Alex hangs out of the window, guzzling from a beer bottle, grinning at the women outside...

TOMMY
“We shall defend our island...”

Alex turns, deliriously happy, beer running down his chin -

ALEX
What?!

TOMMY
(louder, over the celebration)
“We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be - we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds...”


EXT. DUNKIRK HARBOUR - EVENING

Bodies gently bob in the water...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight in the fields and the streets...”

Abandoned trucks and anti-aircraft guns, piles of boots, stacks of rifles catch the last light...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“We shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender...”

Bodies line the length of the mole...

TOMMY (V.O.)
‘And even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island... were subjugated and starving...”


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - CONTINUOUS

Farrier kneels, hands on head, as dark shapes of German soldiers (seen only from behind) surround him...
 

TOMMY (V.O.)
“Then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle...”

Farrier is led away from the burning plane...

Alex is oblivious. Tommy continues, to himself...

TOMMY
“Until, in God’s good time...”


EXT. BEACH AT LA PANNE - CONTINUOUS

Moving towards the burning Spitfire...

TOMMY (V.O.)
“The New World, with all its power and might -”

INT. BEDROOM, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
A man WAKES, nightmare SWEATY. This is COOPER.
YOUNG GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
Dad? Dad?
Cooper turns: in the doorway - his sleepy ten-year-old daughter. This is MURPH.
COOPER
Sorry. Go back to sleep.
MURPH
I thought you were the ghost.
COOPER
There’s no ghost, Murph.
MURPH
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
COOPER
Maybe Grandpa’s a little too close to being one himself. Back to sleep.

MURPH
Were you dreaming about the crash?
COOPER
Back to sleep, Murph.
Murph shuffles back out the door. Cooper moves to the window. DAWN breaks over an ENDLESS SEA OF CORN ...
 

ELDERLY FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Corn, sure. But dust. In your ears, your mouth...

INSERT CUT: AN OLD-TIMER IN CLOSE UP, WATERY-EYED, DESCRIBES DUST BOWL CONDITIONS.

OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
Dust just everywhere. Everywhere.

EXT. COOPER’S FARM - MORNING
An old man, handkerchief across his face, sweeps dust out of the door onto the porch. This is Grandpa (DONALD).

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MORNING
Cooper pours himself coffee as Donald puts grits on the table. TOM, Cooper’s fifteen-year-old son, stuffs his face.

Murph, wet hair, towel around neck, plays with pieces of a MODEL (a lunar lander).
DONALD
Not at the table, Murph.
MURPH
Dad, can you fix this?
COOPER
(takes pieces, frowning) What’d you do to my lander?
MURPH
Wasn’t me.
TOM
Lemme guess - your ghost?
MURPH
It knocked it off my shelf. It keeps knocking books off.
TOM
There’s no such things as ghosts, dumb-ass -
 

 


Hey -
 
COOPER
(to Tom)

MURPH
 
I looked it up, it’s called a poltergeist.
TOM
Dad, tell her.
COOPER
Murph, you know that’s not scientific.
MURPH
You say science is about admitting what we don’t know.
DONALD
She’s got you there.
COOPER
(hands her pieces)
Start looking after our stuff.
Donald looks at Cooper, admonishing. Cooper shrugs.
COOPER
Fine. Murph, you wanna talk science, don’t just tell me you’re scared of some ghost - record the facts, analyze, present your conclusions.
MURPH
Sure.
Cooper gets up, grabs his keys.
DONALD
Hold up.
(Off look.)
Parent-teacher conferences. ’Parent’ - not ’grandparent’.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The kids pile into an old pickup truck, scraping DUST off the seats. Cooper, coffee in hand, peers at a black cloud.
 

COOPER
Dust storm?
DONALD
(shakes his head)
Nelson’s torching his whole crop.
COOPER
Blight?
DONALD
They’re saying it’s the last harvest for okra. Ever.
Cooper stares at the smoke. Uneasy. Gets into the truck.
COOPER
Shoulda planted corn like the rest of us.

DONALD
Be nice to Miss Hanley. She’s single.

COOPER
What’s that supposed to mean?
DONALD
Repopulating the Earth - start pulling your weight.
COOPER
Start minding your business.

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DIRT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper sips his coffee, steering while Murph shifts -
COOPER
Okay, gimme second -
Murph wrestles the long gear stick into second. Cooper sips.
COOPER
Now third -
Murph struggles to find third - GRIND.
TOM
Find a gear, dumb-ass.
 
MURPH
Shut up, Tom!
BANG - A TIRE BLOWS OUT. Cooper stops the truck.
TOM
What’d you do, Murph?
COOPER
She didn’t do anything. We lost a tire is all.
TOM
Murphy’s Law.
MURPH
Shut up, Tom.
Cooper gets out of the truck, checks the flat, turns to Tom.
COOPER
Grab the spare.
TOM
That is the spare.
COOPER
Okay, patch kit.
TOM
How’m I supposed to patch it out here?

COOPER
Figure it out. I’m not always going to be here to help you.
Tom moves to the back of the truck. Murph is there.
MURPH
Why’d you and Mom name me after something bad?
COOPER
We didn’t.
MURPH
Murphy’s Law?
COOPER
Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean bad stuff will happen. It means ’whatever can happen, will happen’. And that sounded just fine to us.
 
Murph frowns, hearing something ...
COOPER
What?
Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLE. Cooper GRABS Murph as a DRONE SOARS low overhead -
COOPER
Come on!
Cooper jumps into the truck - he pulls out a laptop and antenna hands them to Murph - shouts at Tom -
COOPER
Get in!
TOM
(jack in hand) What about the tire?

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK THROUGH FIELDS - MOMENTS LATER
Close on the SHREDDING TIRE as the truck BARRELS through cornfields. Murph fires up the laptop. Cooper strains to see through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon -
TOM
There!
To the right, the dark shape of the drone, cruising low over the fields. Cooper JERKS the wheel - the drone has long, thin wings like a U-2, but no cockpit.
COOPER
Indian air force surveillance drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
(To Tom.) Take the wheel -
Tom takes the wheel - Cooper hands Murph the antenna.
COOPER
Keep it pointed right at it -
Cooper works the laptop - the screen fills with Hindi.
Faster, Tom. I’m losing it.
Tom WEAVES through the corn - they round a corner, almost HIT a HARVESTER - BANG - the truck loses a wing mirror -
Ahead the drone SOARS, banking, pulling away -
 

The truck BURSTS out of the corn, Cooper’s nose is in the laptop.

 

Dad?
 
TOM

COOPER
 
Almost got it. Don’t stop.
In front of them, the drone plummets from view into the next valley - the path ahead leads to a three-hundred-foot drop.
TOM
 
DAD ...
Cooper looks up.

Tom!
 



COOPER
 

Tom locks up the brakes. Cooper looks at him - he shrugs.
TOM
You told me to keep going.
Cooper grabs the laptop and opens the door.
COOPER
Guess that answers the ’if I told you to drive off a cliff’ scenario.
Murph is still pointing the antenna.
MURPH
We lost it.
COOPER
(smiles) No, we didn’t.

The DRONE SOARS BACK OVER THEM - Cooper is moving his fingers across the track pad, PILOTING THE DRONE.

As the kids watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring over them, banking above the valley. Cooper crouches next to Murph.
COOPER
Want to give it a whirl?
Murph, guided by Cooper, moves her fingers across the track pad - the massive drone BANKS in response. Murph is in heaven.
 

COOPER
Let’s set her down next to the river.

EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER
The truck limps up to the drone. Cooper and the kids climb down. Cooper runs a hand along the smooth carbon flank of the aircraft.

TOM
How long you think it’s been up there?

COOPER
Delhi mission control went down same as ours, ten years ago.
TOM
It’s been up there ten years? Why’d it come down so low?
COOPER
Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it came down looking for something.
MURPH
What?
COOPER
Some kind of signal. Who knows?
Cooper finds an access hatch. Pries it open. Examines the black-box brain of the machine.
MURPH
What are you going to do with it?
COOPER
Give it something socially responsible to do, like drive a combine.

MURPH
Couldn’t we just let it go? It’s not hurting anyone.
Cooper looks down at his daughter. Good kid.
COOPER
This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us.
 

EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL - DAY
The truck pulls up to school, drone fuselage hanging out.
COOPER
How’s this work? You guys come with?

TOM
I’ve got class. But she ...
Pats Murph on shoulder.
Needs to wait.
Murph glares at Tom as he hops out.
COOPER
Why? What?
MURPH
Dad, I had a thing ... well, they’ll tell you about it. Just try and ...

COOPER
Am I gonna be mad?
MURPH
Not with me. Just try not to -
COOPER
Relax, I got this.
Murph pulls out a notebook. Starts drawing a BARCODE.

INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER (MORNING)
Cooper enters, awkward. The PRINCIPAL (male, fifties) turns from the window.

PRINCIPAL
Little late, Coop. (Indicates chair.)
Guess you had to stop off at the Asian fighter plane store.
COOPER
(sits, smiles)
Actually, sir, it’s a surveillance drone. With outstanding solar cells.
 

Cooper nods at Murph’s teacher, Ms Hanley, thirties, attractive.

PRINCIPAL
We got Tom’s scores back. He’s going to make an excellent farmer. Congratulations.
The Principal slides a paper across the desk.
COOPER
(taken aback) What about college?
PRINCIPAL
The university only takes a handful. They don’t have resources
-

COOPER
I’m still paying taxes - where’s that go? There’s no more armies.
PRINCIPAL
Not to the university. Coop, you have to be realistic.
COOPER
You’re ruling him out for college now? He’s fifteen.
PRINCIPAL
Tom’s score simply isn’t high enough.

COOPER
What’re you? About a thirty-six-inch waist?
(Beat.) Thirty-inch inseam?
PRINCIPAL
I’m not sure I see what -
COOPER
You’re telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son’s future?
Ms Hanley stifles a laugh. The Principal shoots her a look.
 

PRINCIPAL
You’re a well educated man, Coop. A trained pilot -
COOPER
And an engineer.
PRINCIPAL
Okay. Well, right now the world doesn’t need more engineers. We didn’t run out of planes, or television sets. We ran out of food.
Cooper leans back. He’s not going to win this one.
PRINCIPAL
The world needs farmers. Good farmers, like you. And Tom.
(Smiles benignly.)
We’re a caretaker generation. And things are getting better. Maybe your grandchildren -
COOPER
Are we done, sir?
PRINCIPAL
No. Ms Hanley is here to talk about Murph.
Cooper shifts his gaze to Ms Hanley.
MS HANLEY
Murph’s a bright kid. A wonderful kid, Mr Cooper. But she’s been having a little trouble ...
Ms Hanley places a textbook on the desk.
She brought this to school, to show the other kids the section on the lunar landings ...
COOPER
Yeah, it’s one of my old textbooks, she likes the pictures.
MS HANLEY
This is an old federal textbook. We’ve replaced them with corrected versions.
 

COOPER
Corrected?
MS HANLEY
Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

COOPER
You don’t believe we went to the moon?

MS HANLEY
(tolerant smile)
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.
COOPER
’Useless machines’?
MS HANLEY
Yes, Mr Cooper. And if we don’t want a repeat of the wastefulness and excess of the twentieth century, our children need to learn about this planet, not tales of leaving it.
Cooper considers this in silence. Looks at Ms Hanley.
COOPER
One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. And if we had any of them left, the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife’s brain before she died, rather than afterwards. Then she could be sitting here listening to this, which’d be good, cos she was always the calmer one ...
Ms Hanley looks at Cooper, embarrassed. Then -
MS HANLEY
I’m sorry about your wife, Mr Cooper. But Murph got into a fist fight with several of her classmates over this Apollo nonsense and we thought it best to
(MORE)
 

MS HANLEY (cont’d)
bring you in and see what ideas you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front.
COOPER
Sure. Well, there’s a ball game tomorrow night, and Murph’s going through a bit of a baseball phase. There’ll be candy and soda ...
Ms Hanley looks at him, expectant.
COOPER
I think I’ll take her to that.
Ms Hanley turns to the Principal, not happy.

EXT. PICKUP TRUCK OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
Murph looks up from her notebook at her dad, expectantly.
MURPH
How’d it go?
COOPER
I, uh ... got you suspended.
MURPH
 
What?! Sorry.
 
COOPER MURPH
 
Dad! I told you not to - The CB radio CRACKLES to life.
CB OPERATOR
Cooper? Boots for Cooper.
COOPER
Cooper.
BOOTS
(over radio)
Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.
 

COOPER
Power the controllers down for a couple minutes.
BOOTS
(over radio)
Did that. You should come take a look, it’s kinda weird.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
Cooper and Murph pass a slow-moving harvester pulling up to the house, which is surrounded by AUTOMATED FARM MACHINES. They’ve nosed up to the house like animals at a Nativity.
Boots, the farm hand, approaches -
BOOTS
One by one they been peeling off from the fields and heading over.

Cooper pops open the cabin to a harvester. Checks the auto pilot hooked up to the controls.
BOOTS
Something’s interfering with their compass ...
Cooper jumps down and heads to the front door. Enters.
BOOTS (O.S.)
Magnetism or some such ...

INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks at the kitchen. Nothing. Murph comes in.
MURPH
What is it, Dad?
A small BANG from upstairs. Cooper heads up.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph’s bedroom clearly used to be her mother’s. Cooper, in the doorway, looks at the wall of BOOKS opposite - several GAPS. He looks down at some books on the floor.
MURPH
Nothing special about which books. (Off look.)
(MORE)
 

MURPH (cont’d)
Been working on it, like you said.
Murph holds up her notebook with its barcode.
MURPH
I counted the spaces.
COOPER
Why?
MURPH
In case the ghost’s trying to say something. I’m trying Morse.
COOPER
Morse?
MURPH
Yeah. Dots and dashes, used for -
COOPER
Murph, I know what Morse code is. I just don’t think your bookshelf’s trying to talk to you.
He leaves. Murph, embarrassed, turns back to the shelf.

INT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Donald hands Cooper a beer.
COOPER
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
DONALD
Which is?
COOPER
No idea. If the house was built on magnetic ore, we’d’ve seen this the first time we switched on a tractor.
Donald nods. Sips.

DONALD
Sounds like your meeting at school didn’t go so well.
 

COOPER
(sighs)
We’ve forgotten who we are, Donald. Explorers, pioneers. Not caretakers.
Donald nods, thoughtful. Weighs up his words.
DONALD
When I was a kid it felt like they made something new every day. Some gadget or idea. Like every day was Christmas. But six billion people
... just try to imagine that. And every last one of them trying to have it all.
He turns to Cooper.
This world isn’t so bad. And Tom’ll do just fine - you’re the one who doesn’t belong. Born forty years too late, or forty years too early. My daughter knew it, God bless her. And your kids know it. ’Specially Murph.

COOPER
We used to look up and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.
DONALD
Cooper, you were good at something and you never got a chance to do anything with it. I’m sorry. But that’s not your kids’ fault.
Cooper looks up at the stars above.
OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
May 14th. Never forget. Clear as a bell. You’d never think ...

INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER REMEMBERS. CUT TO A SECOND OLD-TIMER ...

SECOND OLD-TIMER
When the first of the real big ones rolled in ... I thought it was the end of the world.
 

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
The CRACK of ball off bat - a pop-fly caught to a trickle of applause. Half-filled stands at what looks like a minor league game.

DONALD
In my day we had real ball players. Who’re these bums?
As the team runs in from the field we see: NEW YORK YANKEES.
COOPER
Well, in my day people were too busy fighting over food for baseball, so consider this progress.
Murph offers Donald some popcorn.
DONALD
Fine. But popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. I want a hot dog.
MURPH
(confused) What’s a hot dog?
Cooper sits with Tom a row in front.
COOPER
The school says you’re gonna follow in my footsteps. I think that’s great.

TOM
You think that’s great?
MURPH
You hate farming, Dad. Grandpa said.
Cooper looks at Donald, who shrugs ’sorry’.
COOPER
What’s important is how you feel about it, Tom.
TOM
I like what you do. I like our farm.
 

On the field: the batter hits one along the ground - it rolls to an infielder’s foot - but the infielder IGNORES it, STARING up at the sky. The crowd starts to look up ...
OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
You’ve never seen the like. Black. Just black ...
INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER CHOKES BACK FEAR AS HE REMEMBERS.
Cooper stares at the horizon, where an ENORMOUS BLACK DUST STORM IS MASSING. People start leaving, tying handkerchiefs across their faces.

COOPER
Come on, guys.

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper speeds along as Donald and the kids stuff RAGS into cracks and vents ... behind them the WALL OF BLACK DUST ADVANCES, SWALLOWING UP ROADS, BUILDINGS. A nasty SOUND is
developing - the truck ROCKING with GUSTS of wind ...
Suddenly, BLACK DUST ENVELOPS the car, LIGHTNING CRACKLING.
DONALD
It’s a bad one ...
COOPER
Mask up, guys.
Murph and Tom take SURGICAL MASKS out of the glove box.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
VISIBILITY MERE FEET as the dust storm BRUTALIZES the farm. The truck CRAWLS up to the house. Cooper leans in to try and see better ... CRACK - a panel of sheet metal SMASHES into the windshield - Cooper turns - wrestles Murph out of the truck as Donald blindly stumbles towards the front door with Tom ...

INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The SHUTTERS BANG as the wind WHIPS around the house, FORCING JETS OF DUST up through cracks in the window frames, floorboards ... Donald SLAMS the door. Murph is COUGHING ... Cooper looks around. Sees dust coming from upstairs.
 

COOPER
Did you both shut your windows?
Tom nods. Murph looks at Cooper. Runs for the stairs.
COOPER
Wait -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper gets to the doorway. Murph stands in the middle of the room, STARING. Cooper SHUTS the window. The dust hangs in the relative quiet. Murph is staring, TRANSFIXED, at LINES where dust is FALLING UNNATURALLY FAST, STREAMING DOWN
through the air, collecting on the floor in a PATTERN -
MURPH
The Ghost.
Cooper STARES at dust collecting like snow on power lines...
COOPER
Grab your pillow, sleep in with Tom.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN - MORNING
Calm. Dust settled.

INT. TOM’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph slips out of bed, wrapped in her blanket. Pads down the hall, peeks in her bedroom door at -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper sits, staring at the PATTERN of dust: thick radial lines, like a CIRCULAR BARCODE. Murph sits down next to her dad. They STARE at it together. He holds up a coin ...
COOPER
It’s not a ghost ...
Cooper tosses the coin across a line. It SHOOTS at the floor
-
It’s gravity.
 

INT. SAME - LATER
Donald pokes his head in.
DONALD
I’m dropping Tom, then heading to town ...
(Looks at dust pattern.)
You wanna clean that up when you’ve finished praying to it?
Cooper reaches for Murph’s notebook. Starts writing ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - LATER
Murph fills a glass of water. Picks up a plate of sandwiches.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Follow Murph into the room, to find Cooper standing there.
COOPER
I got something.
Cooper is pointing to the thick and thin radial lines - Binary. Thick is one, thin is zero
- it’s numbers ... number pairs...
He holds up the notebook to show Murph the number pairs.
Coordinates.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper and Murph pore over MAPS. Cooper TOSSES one aside, lays it out on the table. Finds a spot. Looks up at Murph
...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper packing his truck - sleeping bag, flashlight ...
MURPH
You can’t leave me behind!
COOPER
Grandpa’s back in two hours.
 

MURPH
You don’t know what you’re going to find -

COOPER
That’s why I can’t take you.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper grabs the maps and a bottle of water. He calls up -
COOPER
 

Nothing.
 
Murph?

Murph, just wait here for Grandpa. Tell him I’ll call him on the radio.
 

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper drives, map spread on the wheel, looks for a pen - reaches over to the passenger wheel well - lifts a BLANKET - Murph is there -

 

JESUS!
 
COOPER
 

The truck WOBBLES as Cooper regains control.
Murph, what are you doing?!
Murph is LAUGHING as she climbs into the passenger seat -
COOPER
It’s not funny -
But Murph’s laugh is infectious.
MURPH
You wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for me.
Cooper hands Murph the map.
COOPER
Fair enough. Make yourself useful...
The pickup cruises down the road, heading for the MOUNTAINS.
 

EXT. PLAINS APPROACHING MOUNTAINS - DUSK
The tiny pickup is dwarfed by the darkening foothills.

EXT. DIRT ROAD OFF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
Cooper pulls up to a gate in chain-link fence. Murph is asleep next to him.

COOPER
Murph. Murph.
Murph wakes.
I think this is as far as we get.
Murph glances out at the fence. Closes her eyes again.
MURPH
Why? You didn’t bring the bolt-cutters?
COOPER
I like your spirit, young lady.
Cooper gets out of the truck, retrieves his bolt-cutters and comes up to the fence. He looks up and down the road.
Nothing. He reaches out and puts the jaws of the cutters -
WHAM! SPOTLIGHTS IN COOPER’S EYES - A HARSH ELECTRIC VOICE -
VOICE
STEP AWAY FROM THE FENCE.
Cooper drops the cutters, puts his hands in the air -
COOPER
Don’t shoot! My child is in the car! I’m unarmed! My daughter is -

Murph watches, terrified as, with a ZAP, Cooper DROPS. Murph SCRAMBLES back along the seat as MASSIVE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. The door is WRENCHED open - a BLINDING LIGHT

VOICE DON’T BE AFRAID.
Murph SCREAMS.
 

INT. BRIGHT, INDUSTRIAL ROOM - LATER
Cooper comes to, sitting in a chair. Opposite him is an ARTICULATED MACHINE. A VOICE emanates from its side.
MACHINE
How did you find this place?
COOPER
Where’s my daughter?
MACHINE
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map. Where did you get them?
Cooper leans in to the machine.
COOPER WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!
Cooper’s scream REVERBERATES. Cooper sizes up the machine.
You might think you’re still in the Marines, but the Marines don’t exist anymore, pal. I’ve got grunts like you mowing my grass ...
The Machine RISES to its full height.
MACHINE
How did you find us?
COOPER
But you don’t look like a lawnmower to me ... you, I’m gonna turn into an overqualified vacuum cleaner -
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
No, you’re not.
Cooper turns to see a businesslike woman in her thirties.
WOMAN
Tars, back down, please.
The machine, TARS, sinks back down.
COOPER
You’re taking a risk using
ex-military for security. They’re old, their control units are unpredictable ...
 

WOMAN
Well, that’s what the government could spare.
COOPER
Who are you?
WOMAN
Dr Brand.
COOPER
I knew a Dr Brand once. But he was a professor -
WOMAN (BRAND)
What makes you think I’m not?
COOPER
And nowhere near as cute.
BRAND
You think you can flirt your way out of this mess?
COOPER
(honest, scared)
Dr Brand, I have no idea what this mess is. I’m scared for my little girl and I want her by my side.
Then I’ll tell you anything you want to know. Okay?
Brand considers this. Turns to Tars.
BRAND
Get the principals and the girl into the conference room.
(To Cooper.)
Your daughter’s fine. Bright kid. (Rises.)
Must have a very smart mother.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper follows Brand into a corridor. Tars LURCHES behind.
COOPER
It’s pretty clear you don’t want visitors - why not let us back up from your fence and be on our way?
 

BRAND
It’s not that simple.
COOPER
Sure it is. I don’t know anything about you or this place.
BRAND
Yes, you do.
Brand ushers Cooper through a door into a conference room -

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Where an OLD MAN is crouched down, talking to Murph.
MURPH
Dad!
Murph runs into Cooper’s arms. The Old Man SMILES at Cooper.
OLD MAN
Hello, Cooper.
COOPER
(stunned) Professor Brand?
MAN AT TABLE (DOYLE)
Just take a seat, Mr Cooper.
Cooper and Murph sit at a table where five people are waiting - a bespectacled man, WILLIAMS, leans forward to address Cooper.

WILLIAMS
Explain how you found this facility.

COOPER
Stumbled across it. Looking for salvage and I saw the fence -
WILLIAMS
You’re sitting in the world’s best kept secret - you don’t stumble in. And you certainly don’t stumble out.

PROFESSOR BRAND
Cooper, please. Cooperate with these people.
 

Cooper looks nervously around the room.
COOPER
It’s hard to explain, but we learned these coordinates from an anomaly ...
DOYLE
What sort of anomaly?
COOPER
I don’t want to term it ’supernatural’ ... but ...
Cooper is losing them. Williams leans forward. Serious.
WILLIAMS
You’re going to have to, Mr Cooper. Real quick.
COOPER
After that last storm, it was a pattern ... in dust ...
MURPH
It was gravity.
All eyes turn to Murph. She’s said the magic word. Doyle looks at Professor Brand, excited. Turns to Cooper -
DOYLE
Where was this gravitational anomaly?

COOPER
Look, I’m happy you’re excited about gravity, but if you want more answers from us I’m gonna need assurances -
WILLIAMS
Assurances?
Cooper looks at Murph. Then covers Murph’s ears.
COOPER
That we’re getting out of here ... and not in the trunk of some car.
Brand laughs. Williams smiles. Cooper looks confused.
 

PROFESSOR BRAND
Don’t you know who we are, Coop?
COOPER
No. No, I don’t.
BRAND
(points around table) Williams, Doyle, Jenkins, Smith, you already know my father, Professor Brand. We’re NASA.
COOPER
NASA?
PROFESSOR BRAND
NASA. Same NASA you flew for.
Now Cooper is laughing, too. Murph looks around, confused.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Professor Brand shows Cooper the facility.
COOPER
I heard you got shut down for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere onto starving people.
PROFESSOR BRAND
When they realized killing other people wasn’t a long term solution they needed us back. Set us up in the old NORAD facility. In secret.
COOPER
Why secret?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Public opinion won’t allow spending on space exploration. Not when we’re struggling to put food on the table.
Professor Brand ushers Cooper through a large door -
 

INT. GREENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Professor Brand gestures to large PLANTATIONS under glass.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Blight. Wheat seven years ago, okra this year. Now there’s just corn.
COOPER
But we’re growing more than ever -
PROFESSOR BRAND
Like the potatoes in Ireland, like the wheat in the dust bowl, the corn will die. Soon.
Brand enters with Murph. She shows her the greenhouses.
COOPER
We’ll find a way, we always have.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Driven by the unshakable faith that the Earth is ours.
COOPER
Not just ours, but it is our home.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Earth’s atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen. We don’t even breathe nitrogen.

Professor Brand shows him a blighted stalk. Blight does. And as it thrives our air contains less and less oxygen
...
Professor Brand gestures over at Murph ... The last people to starve will be the first to suffocate. Your daughter’s generation will be the last to survive on Earth.
Cooper looks over at Murph. Then back to Professor Brand.
COOPER
Tell me this is where you explain how you’re going to save the world.
 

INT. VAST CIRCULAR CHAMBER (LAUNCH FACILITY) - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper and Professor Brand enter like ants in a grain silo. A ROCKET is on a pad, DWARFED by the circular chamber. Far above, a ring of mirrors reflects the dawn down into the facility.

PROFESSOR BRAND
We’re not meant to save the world
... we’re meant to leave it.
Cooper stares up at the rocket. He recognizes the arrangement of two CRAFT at the top.
COOPER
Rangers.
PROFESSOR BRAND
The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit, the Endurance. Our final expedition.
COOPER
What happened to the other vehicles?

PROFESSOR BRAND
The Lazarus missions.
COOPER
Sounds cheerful.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Lazarus came back from the dead -
COOPER
He had to die in the first place. You sent people out there looking for a new home ...
Professor Brand nods.
There’s no planet in our solar system that can support life ... and it’d take them a thousand years to reach the nearest star - that doesn’t even qualify as futile ... Where did you send them, Professor?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Cooper, I can’t tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft. You’re the best we ever had.
 
COOPER
I barely left the stratosphere.
PROFESSOR BRAND
This crew’s never left the simulator. We can’t program this mission from Earth, we don’t know what’s out there. We need a pilot. And this is the mission you were trained for.
COOPER
Without ever knowing. An hour ago, you didn’t even know I was still alive. And you were going anyway.
PROFESSOR BRAND
We had no choice. But something brought you here. They chose you.
COOPER
Who’s ’they’?
Professor Brand is silent. Cooper wrestles.
How long would I be gone?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Hard to know. Years.
COOPER
I’ve got my kids, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Get out there and save them.
Cooper considers this. Decides.
COOPER
Who’s ’they’?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
A man in his forties has the solar system up on the screen. This is ROMILLY.

ROMILLY
We started detecting gravitational anomalies almost fifty years ago. Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere
- I believe you encountered one yourself ...
 

COOPER
(realizing)
Over the Straights - my crash - something tripped my fly-by wire -
ROMILLY
Exactly. But the most significant anomaly was this ...

Cooper stares at an image of Saturn and its moons. Romilly zooms in on some stars DISTORTED like ripples in a pond.
ROMILLY
A disturbance of spacetime out near Saturn.

COOPER
A wormhole?
ROMILLY
It appeared forty-eight years ago.
COOPER
Where does it lead?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Another galaxy.
COOPER
A wormhole isn’t a naturally occurring phenomenon.
BRAND
Someone placed it there.
COOPER
’They’.
BRAND
And whoever ’They’ are, they appear to be looking out for us - that wormhole lets us travel to other stars. It came along right as we needed it.

DOYLE
They’ve put potentially habitable worlds within our reach. Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
COOPER
You sent probes into it?
 

PROFESSOR BRAND
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

COOPER
The Lazarus missions.
Professor Brand rises and moves to a MEMORIAL, pointing -
PROFESSOR BRAND
Twelve possible worlds. Twelve Ranger launches carrying the bravest humans ever to live, led by the remarkable Dr Mann.
DOYLE
Each person’s landing pod had life support for two years - but they could use hibernation to stretch that, making observations on organics over a decade or more.
Their mission was to assess their world, and if it showed promise, send a signal, bed down for the long nap, and wait to be rescued.
COOPER
And if their world didn’t show promise?

DOYLE
Hence the bravery.
COOPER
Because you don’t have resources to visit all twelve.
DOYLE
No. Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary, simple binary ’pings’ on an annual basis to give some clue as to which worlds have potential. One system shows promise.
COOPER
One? Kind of a long shot.
BRAND
One system with three potential worlds ... no long shot.
 

COOPER
So if we find a new home, what then?

PROFESSOR BRAND
That’s the long shot. There’s Plan A and there’s Plan B. Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber ...

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper cocks his head, puzzling at the VAST chamber ... there are structures built SIDEWAYS around the CURVED walls...

COOPER
This whole facility ... it’s a vehicle? A space station?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Both. We’ve been working on it, and others like it for twenty-five years. Plan A.
COOPER
How does it get off the Earth?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Those first gravitational anomalies changed everything - suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real. So I started working on the theory - and we start building this station.

COOPER
But you haven’t solved it, yet.
PROFESSOR BRAND
That’s why there’s a Plan B.

INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER
TECHNICIANS work the complex, high-tech lab. Professor Brand and Cooper follow Brand to a large glass and steel apparatus.

BRAND
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable amount of human life off
(MORE)
 

BRAND (cont’d)
this planet. This is one way - Plan
B. A population bomb. Almost five thousand fertilized eggs, weighing in at under 900 kilos.
COOPER
How could you raise them?
BRAND
With equipment on board we incubate the first ten. After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential - within thirty years we might have a colony of hundreds. The real difficulty of colonization is genetic diversity,
(Indicates vials.) This takes care of that.
Cooper looks at the equipment. Unenthusiastic.
COOPER
We just give up on the people here?
PROFESSOR BRAND
That’s why Plan A’s a lot more fun.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE
Professor Brand watches Cooper as he gazes over the vast tracts of ALGEBRA covering every available surface.
COOPER
Where have you got to?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Almost there.
COOPER
Almost? You’re asking me to hang everything on an ’almost’?
Professor Brand moves close to Cooper.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m asking you to trust me.
Cooper looks at the passion in Professor Brand’s eyes.
 
COOPER
All those years of training - you never told me.
PROFESSOR BRAND
We can’t always be open about everything, Coop, even if we want to be. What can you tell your children about this mission?
Cooper considers this. Uneasy.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Find us a new home. When you return, I’ll have solved the problem of gravity. You have my word.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE DAY
Donald, on the porch, gets to his feet as he sees Cooper’s pickup approaching. The truck pulls up. Murph TEARS past Grandpa into the house - Donald looks at Cooper, questioning.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE MURPH’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries to open the door, but Murph has stacked a desk and chair against it -
COOPER
Murph?
MURPH
Go! If you’re leaving, just go!

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
Donald looks out at the night, taking it all in.
DONALD
This world never was enough for you, was it, Coop?
COOPER
I’m not gonna lie to you, Donald - heading out there is what I feel born to do and it excites me. That doesn’t make it wrong.
Donald considers this. Turns to Cooper.
 

DONALD
It might. Don’t trust the right thing done for the wrong reason. The ’why’ of a thing? That’s the foundation.
COOPER
(sadly)
Well, the foundation’s solid. (Gestures at landscape.)
We farmers sit here every year when the rains fail and say ’next year’. Next year ain’t gonna save us. Nor the one after. This world’s a treasure, Donald. But she’s been telling us to leave for a while now.
(Stares at the horizon.) Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.
Donald considers this. Scoops the dust off the rail.
DONALD
Tom’ll be okay. But you have to make it right with Murph.
COOPER
I will.
DONALD
Without making any promises you don’t know you can keep.
Cooper meets Donald’s gaze. Looks away, nodding.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Cooper’s hand, reaching in, removes the chair from the desk, barricading the door. Murph is lying on the bed, turned away. Cooper pushes the desk back gently. Enters, quietly.
COOPER
You have to talk to me.

 
Nothing.
 

I have to fix this before I go.
 

Murph turns, tear-stained, angry cheeks blazing -
 
MURPH
Then I’ll keep it broken so you have to stay.
Cooper sits down on the bed next to Murph.
COOPER
After you kids came along, your mother said something I didn’t really understand - she said, ’I look at the babies and I see myself as they’ll remember me.’ She said, ’It’s as if we don’t exist anymore, like we’re ghosts, like now we’re just there to be memories for our kids.’ Now I realize - once we’re parents, we’re just the ghosts of our childrens’ futures.
MURPH
You said ghosts don’t exist.
COOPER
That’s right. I can’t be your ghost right now - I need to exist.
Because they chose me. They chose me, Murph. You saw it. Murph sits up.
Points at the shelves. The gaps.
MURPH
I figured out the message ... (Opens her notebook.)
It was Morse code ...
COOPER
Murph -
MURPH
One word. You know what it is?
Cooper shakes his head sadly. Murph holds out her notebook - ’STAY’. It says ’STAY’, Dad.
COOPER
Oh, Murph.
MURPH
You don’t believe me?! Look the books! Look at -
Cooper takes his daughter in his arms ...
 
COOPER
It’s okay, it’s okay ...
Murph buries her head on Cooper’s shoulder, sobbing.
Murph, a father looks in his child’s eyes and thinks - maybe it’s them ... maybe my child will save the world. And everyone, once a child, wants to look into their own dad’s eyes and know he saw how they saved some little corner of their world. But, usually, by then, the father is gone.
MURPH
Like you will be.
Cooper looks at his daughter. Lies with head, not heart:
COOPER
No. I’m coming back.
MURPH
When?
Cooper reaches into his pocket. Pulls out two WATCHES.
COOPER
One for you. One for me.
Murph takes the watch, curious. Cooper holds up his watch.
When I’m in hyper-sleep, or travel near the speed of light, or near a black hole, time will change for me. It’ll run more slowly. When I get back we’ll compare.
MURPH
Time will run differently for us?
COOPER
Yup. By the time I get back we might even be the same age. You and me. Imagine that ...
Murph takes this in. Cooper sees he’s made a mistake.
Wait, Murph -
MURPH
You have no idea when you’re coming back.
Cooper looks at his daughter.
 

MURPH
No idea at all!
Murph THROWS the watch - TURNS HER BACK.
COOPER
Don’t make me leave like this.

 
Nothing.
 

Please. I have to go now.
 

Murph will not turn around. Cooper tries to rest his hand on the back of her head, but she shakes it off.
COOPER
I love you, Murph. Forever. And I’m coming back.

Cooper walks slowly out. A BOOK DROPS FROM THE SHELF. Cooper turns to look at it. Then leaves.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper, mechanical, puts his small bag in the truck.
DONALD
How’d it go?
COOPER
Fine. It was fine.
Cooper turns to Tom. Hugs him. Tight enough for both kids.
I love you, Tom.
TOM
Travel safe, Dad.
COOPER
(indicates farm)
Look after our place, you hear?
TOM
Can I use your truck while you’re gone?

COOPER
(smiles)
I’ll make sure they bring it back for you.
Cooper gets in. Starts the engine.
Mind my kids for me, Donald.
 

Donald nods. Cooper pulls out.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph jumps off the bed, GRABS the watch, RUNS downstairs.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
As Cooper drives he lifts the blanket in the wheel-well where Murph hid last time. Nothing. And we hear a COUNTDOWN...

VOICE (O.S.)
TEN ... NINE ...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Murph RACES out of the house, watch in hand - MURPH
Dad?! DAD?!
VOICE (V.O.)
EIGHT ... SEVEN ...
But Cooper is a dust trail far down the road.
VOICE (O.S.)
SIX ... FIVE ...
Murph SOBS as her grandpa puts his arms around her ...

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - CONTINUOUS
As Cooper drives away tears roll down his cheeks
VOICE (O.S.)
FOUR ... THREE ... TWO ... ONE ...
 

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY
VOICE (O.S.)
IGNITION.
FIRE SHOOTS FROM THE BASE OF THE ROCKET ... The rocket RISES
slowly from the pad, up into the sky ...

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, in his space helmet, lets the FORCE of the rocket vibrate through him ...

VOICE (O.S.)
Stage one ... SEPARATION.
Cooper starts to see the Earth’s curve through the window...
VOICE (O.S.)
Stage two ... SEPARATION.
And Cooper shakes loose the bonds of Earth.

EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - CONTINUOUS
The rocket RIPS upwards into the sky. INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper glances around the vibrating, cramped cockpit - Brand, Doyle, Romilly, Tars. Tars spots Cooper’s glance -
TARS
All here, Mr Cooper. Plenty of slaves for my robot colony.
Cooper looks at him, confused.
DOYLE
They gave him a humor setting so he’d fit in with his unit better. He thinks it relaxes us.
COOPER
A massive, sarcastic robot. What a great idea.
 

TARS
I have a cue light I can turn on when I’m joking, if you like.
COOPER
Probably help.
TARS
You can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

Tars looks at Cooper. A beat. An LED turns on. Cooper shakes his head.

COOPER
What’s your humor setting, Tars?
TARS
One hundred percent.
Cooper turns to the instruments -
COOPER
Take it to seventy-five, please.

EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
The Rangers streak across the Earth, settle into a low orbit.

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Quiet. Cooper stares down at the continents sliding by. He looks over at Brand who is doing the same, abstracted.
COOPER
We’ll get back.
She stares at the land. The oceans.
It’s hard. Leaving everything. My kids ... your father ...
BRAND
We’re going to spend a lot of time together ...
COOPER
(nods)
We should learn to talk.
 

BRAND
And when not to.
(Off look.)
Just trying to be honest.
COOPER
Maybe you don’t need to be that honest.
(Turns to Tars.) Tars, what’s your honesty parameter?
Tars DISENGAGES from the floor and MOVES to the rear airlock
-

TARS
Ninety percent.
COOPER
Ninety? What kind of robot are you?
TARS
Absolute honesty isn’t always the most diplomatic, or safe form of communication with emotional beings.
Cooper turns to Brand. Shrugs.
COOPER
Ninety percent honesty it is, then.
Brand looks at Cooper. Can’t help smiling.
VOICE
(over radio) Sixty seconds out...

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
The Rangers approach a RING MODULE, fire retro-thrusters and slide gracefully into the center of the ring - the last piece of a large modular craft: the U.S.S. ENDURANCE. Four LANDERS (including the Rangers) are nestled inside the ring module.
 

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
Brand, Doyle and Romilly, following Tars, FLOAT through the cramped cabins, powering up. Tars powers up a second articulated machine, CASE.
DOYLE
Cooper, you should have control.

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE (RANGER) - CONTINUOUS
Cooper checks instruments -
COOPER
Talking fine. Ready to spin?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Doyle and Romilly are strapped in - Brand grabs a handhold -

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
BRAND
(over radio) All set.
Cooper hits a switch ...

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
Thrusters silently fire on the Endurance. It starts ROTATING.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The crew members settle in as gravity is established. Romilly is clearly struggling to find his sea legs in the rotating ship.

BRAND
You okay there?
ROMILLY
Yup. Just need a little time -
BRAND
There should be Dramamine in the hab pod.
 

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
The crew listen to Professor Brand over the video link - PROFESSOR BRAND
(on screen)
I miss you already. Amelia, be safe. Give my regards to Dr Mann.
BRAND
I will, Dad.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(on screen)
Things look good for your trajectory. We’re calculating two years to Saturn.
ROMILLY
That’s a lot of Dramamine ...
Cooper thinks about two years. What it means to his kids.
COOPER
(on screen)
Keep an eye on my family, sir. Specially Murph. She’s a smart one.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(on screen)
We’ll be waiting when you get back
...

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - LATER
Cooper and Doyle flick switches and check instruments - PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
... A little older. A little wiser. But happy to see you ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand, Romilly, Tars and Case strap in.
PROFESSOR BRAND (V.O.)
’Do not go gentle into that good night ...’
 
INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper turns to Doyle. HITS the thrusters.

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
Endurance’s main engines FIRE. The craft PUSHES out of orbit
-

PROFESSOR BRAND (V.O.)
’Rage, rage against the dying of the light.’ God speed, Endurance.
The craft accelerates away from Earth.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
The crew sets up their CRYO-BEDS. Cooper looks out at the diminishing Earth floating in the void. Brand joins him.
COOPER
So alone.
BRAND
We’ve got each other - Dr Mann had it worse.

COOPER
(points at Earth)
I meant them. Look at that perfect planet. We’re not gonna find another one like her.
BRAND
No. This isn’t like looking for a new condo - the human race is going to be adrift ... desperate for a rock to cling to while they catch their breaths. We have to find that rock. Our three prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life.
Brand shows him a blurry image of a dark blue planet.
Laura Miller’s first. She started our biology program.
She shows him a red world, just a tiny dot.
And Wolf Edmunds is here.
Cooper hears something in her voice.
 

COOPER
Who’s Edmunds?
BRAND
(fondly)
Wolf’s a particle physicist.
COOPER
None of them had family?
BRAND
No attachments. My father insisted. They knew the odds against ever seeing another human being. I’m hoping we surprise at least three of them.

COOPER
Tell me about Dr Mann.
Brand replaces the screen image for a grainy, white orb.
BRAND
Remarkable. The best of us. My father’s protégé. He inspired eleven people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history. Scientists, explorers ... That’s what I love - out there we face great odds. Death. But not evil.
COOPER
Nature can’t be evil?
BRAND
Formidable, frightening - not evil. Is a tiger evil because it rips a gazelle to pieces?
COOPER
Just what we bring with us, then.
BRAND
This crew represents the best aspects of humanity.
COOPER
Even me?
Brand looks at him. Smiles.
 

BRAND
Hey, we agreed, ninety percent.
Brand moves to her cryo-bed. Cooper looks out at space.
BRAND
Don’t stay up too late. We can’t spare the resources.
COOPER
Hey, I’ve been waiting a long time to be up here -
BRAND
You are literally wasting your breath.
Cooper nods at her. Joins Tars.
COOPER
Show me the trajectory again.
TARS
Eight months to Mars, then
counter-orbital slingshot around -
Brand’s cryo-bed darkens.
COOPER
(whisper) Tars? Was Dr Brand -
TARS
Why are you whispering? You can’t wake them.

COOPER
Were Dr Brand and Edmunds ... close?

TARS
I wouldn’t know.
COOPER
Is that ninety percent, or ten percent ’wouldn’t know’?
TARS
I also have a discretion setting.
COOPER
So I gather ...
(Rises.)
(MORE)
 

COOPER (cont’d) But not a poker face.

Tars watches Cooper head for the comm. station. He sits down to record a message. Awkward. Stuck. He dives in -
Hey, guys. I’m about settle down for the long nap, so I figured I’d send you an update ...

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance slips away from the small blue planet ...
COOPER (V.O.)
The Earth looks amazing from here
... you can’t see any of the dust -

EXT. CORNFIELDS - DAY
A line of dust slides across the shimmering horizon.
COOPER (V.O.)
Hope you guys are doing great. This should get to you okay ...

EXT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Donald watches two approaching vehicles kick up dust.
COOPER (V.O.)
Professor Brand said he’d make sure of it. Guess I’ll say good night.

Donald recognizes Cooper’s truck ... Murph BURSTS out of the house -

MURPH
(quiet) Is it him?

DONALD
I don’t think so, Murph.
Donald rises to meet the truck. Professor Brand gets out.
 

PROFESSOR BRAND
You must be Donald. Hello, Murph.
MURPH
Why’re you in my dad’s truck?
PROFESSOR BRAND
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
Silence. Professor Brand reaches into his briefcase.
He sent you a message -
Murph TURNS and goes back into the house. Donald takes a disc from Professor Brand.
DONALD
Pretty upset with him for leaving.
PROFESSOR BRAND
If you record messages, I’ll transmit them to Cooper.
Donald nods. Professor Brand looks up at the house.
Murph’s a bright spark. Maybe I could fan the flame.
DONALD
She’s already making fools of her teachers. She should come make a fool out of you.
Professor Brand smiles. Donald looks up into the blue.
Where are they?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Heading towards Mars ...

EXT. MARS - DAY
The Endurance streaks away from Mars ...
PROFESSOR BRAND (V.O.)
Next time we hear from Cooper, they’ll be coming up on Saturn.
 

EXT. SATURN - DAY
The Endurance settles into an orbit around the ringed giant.
TOM (O.S.)
But they said I can start advanced agriculture a year early ...

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, blanket around his shoulders, watches a highly compressed video of Tom -
TOM
Got to go, Dad. Hope you’re safe up there.
Tom makes way for Donald:
DONALD
I’m sorry, Coop, I asked Murph to say hi, but she’s stubborn as her old man. I’ll try again next time, stay safe.

The video cuts out. Cooper gets up, puts a pair of EAR BUDS in his ears and heads into -

OMITTED

INT. HAB POD, RING MODULE - LATER
Cooper enters. Romilly is staring out the window.
COOPER
You good, Rom?
Romilly looks at Cooper.
ROMILLY
It gets to me, Coop. This tin can. Radiation, vacuum outside - everything wants us dead. We’re just not supposed to be here.
Cooper looks at him, sympathetic.
 

COOPER
We’re explorers, Rom, on the greatest ocean of all.
Romilly bangs on the side of the ship.
ROMILLY
Millimeters of aluminium. That’s it. And nothing within millions of miles that won’t kill us in seconds.

COOPER
A lot of the finest solo yachtsmen couldn’t swim. They knew if they went overboard that was it, anyway. This is no different.
Romilly considers this. Cooper passes him his ear buds -
COOPER
Here -
And the sounds of a THUNDERSTORM wash over Romilly, sounds that take us to ...

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance is a tiny speck before the ringed gassy giant.

INT. NAVIGATION, RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks over Doyle’s shoulder - he’s flicking through images of star fields, distorted as if through a fish-eye lens.

COOPER
From the relay probe?
DOYLE
It was in orbit around the wormhole
- each time it swung around we got images of the other side of the foreign galaxy.
COOPER
Like swinging a periscope around?
DOYLE
Exactly.
 
COOPER
So we’ve got a pretty good idea what we’re gonna find on the other side?

DOYLE
Navigationally.
Brand approaches.

BRAND
We’ll be coming up on the wormhole in less than forty-five. Suit up.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - LATER
Cooper straps in, peering out at the inky blackness past Saturn. Romilly joins him there, excited.
COOPER
(over radio)
Strap in - I’m killing the spin ...

EXT. SATURN - CONTINUOUS
As the Endurance streaks past Saturn, it stops rotating, headed for a DISTORTED BLUR of stars.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
ROMILLY
There!
He points at the SPHERICAL blur of stars.
ROMILLY
That’s it! That’s the wormhole!
COOPER
Say it, don’t spray it, Rom.
ROMILLY
Cooper, this is a portal, cutting through spacetime -
(Points.)
We’re seeing into the heart of a galaxy so far away we don’t even know where it is in the universe.

Cooper stares at the wormhole as they approach: a massive spherical lens into another galaxy.
 

COOPER
It’s a sphere.
ROMILLY
Of course it is. You thought it would be just a hole?
COOPER
No ... well, in all the illustrations -
Romilly grabs a piece of paper, draws two points, far apart
-

ROMILLY
In the illustrations they’re trying to show you how it works -

He pokes a hole in one point with his pen ... So they say ’You wanna go from here to there but it’s too far? A wormhole bends space like this ...’

He folds the paper over and jams the pen through the second point, connecting them.
ROMILLY
’So you can take a shortcut across a higher dimension.’ But to show that, they’ve turned
three-dimensional space ... (Gestures around.)
Into two dimensions. (Hold up paper.)
Which turns the wormhole into two dimensions ... a circle.
(Indicates hole in paper.) But what’s a circle in three dimensions?
COOPER
A sphere.
ROMILLY
Exactly.
(Points out window.) It’s a spherical hole ...
Cooper marvels at the concept. And at the looming sphere ...
And who put it here? Who do we thank?
 

COOPER
I’m not thanking anyone till we get through it in one piece.

OMITTED

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
As the Endurance SWINGS around the wormhole, the view of the foreign galaxy SWINGS in opposition, like an ENORMOUS SHAVING MIRROR ... it’s extremely disorienting.

The Endurance fires retro-thrusters to slow, descending towards the wormhole ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is at the controls. Doyle is next to him.
COOPER
Any trick to this?
DOYLE
No one knows.
COOPER
(glances at Doyle)
But the others made it, right?
DOYLE
At least some of them.
COOPER
Thanks for the confidence boost.
Cooper stares down into the vast lens of the wormhole.
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?
ROMILLY
(over radio) To our galaxy ...

Cooper pushes the sticks forward, nosing down and letting gravity PULL them towards the center of the wormhole ...
 

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance reaches the surface of the wormhole. As it crosses the threshold it becomes apparent that THERE IS NO SURFACE ... the craft simply passes into the space of the distortion, its own warped reflection flickering towards it as if the ship were leaning into a giant shaving mirror ...

INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Doyle stare at the distortion of space ahead ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Romilly look out at reflections bordering the bulk
- a space beyond our three dimensions ...

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance moves through a TUNNEL OF DISTORTED REFLECTIONS, seeming to gather more and more dizzying speed, but getting no closer to the far mouth, as if on an accelerating treadmill -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, awestruck, checks his instruments -
DOYLE
They won’t help you in here. We’re cutting through the bulk - space beyond our three dimensions ...
(Checks his equipment.) All we can do is record and observe.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand JUMPS - a shape in the air in front of her is BENDING, warping to form ripples in spacetime inside the cabin - Romilly STARES at the distortion -
ROMILLY
What is that?!
Brand watches the distortion move towards her -
 

BRAND
I think - I think it’s them.
ROMILLY
Distorting spacetime? Don’t -!
Brand is reaching out towards the warped space - it MOVES towards her, DISTORTING her hand - but Brand is not in pain
...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Doyle watch the tunnel mouth STREAK towards them, a mass of stars and nebulae GROWING ...

EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance slides out of the wormhole.

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Suddenly, the instruments are chirping -
DOYLE
We’re ... here.
Cooper and Doyle look out at the new galaxy ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand’s hand is back to normal. She stares at her fingers.
ROMILLY
What was that?
Brand flexes her fingers, delighted.
BRAND
The first handshake.

EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The cosmos is more CROWDED here - STAR upon STAR, NEBULAE
...
 
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
Doyle calls up data on a workstation -
DOYLE
The lost communications came through -

 

How?
 
BRAND

DOYLE
 
The relay on this side cached them.
Doyle flicks through data -
Years of basic data - no real surprises. Miller’s site has kept pinging thumbs up, as has Mann ... but Edmunds went down, three years ago.

BRAND
Transmitter failure?
DOYLE
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up right till it went dark.
ROMILLY
Miller still looks good?
Doyle nods. Romilly is drawing on a whiteboard - She’s coming up fast ... with one complication - the planet is much closer to Gargantua than we
thought.

COOPER
Gargantua?
DOYLE
A very large black hole. Miller’s and Dr Mann’s planets orbit it.
BRAND
And Miller’s is on the horizon?
ROMILLY
A basketball around the hoop. Landing there takes us dangerously close. A black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.
Cooper glances around the concerned faces -
 

COOPER
Look, I can swing around that neutron star to decelerate -
BRAND
It’s not that, it’s time. That gravity will slow our clock compared to Earth’s. Drastically.
COOPER
How bad?
ROMILLY
Every hour we spend on that planet will be maybe ... seven years back on Earth.

COOPER
Jesus -
ROMILLY
That’s relativity, folks.
COOPER
We can’t drop down there without considering the consequences.
DOYLE
Cooper, we have a mission - COOPER That’s easy for you to say - you don’t have anyone back on Earth waiting for you, do you?
DOYLE
You have no idea what’s easy for me.

BRAND
Cooper’s right. We have to think of time as a resource, just like oxygen and food. Going down there is going to cost us.
Doyle steps up to the screen, points out three planets.
DOYLE
Look, Dr Mann’s data is promising, but we won’t get there for months. Edmunds is even further. Miller hasn’t sent much, but what she has sent is promising - water, organics
...
 
BRAND
You don’t find that every day. DOYLE No, you do not. So think about the resources it would take to come back here ...

They look at each other, considering. Cooper turns to Romilly -

COOPER
How far off the planet do we have to stay to be out of the time shift?
Romilly indicates a spot on his white board.
ROMILLY
Just back from the cusp.
COOPER
So we track a wider orbit of Gargantua, parallel with Miller’s planet but a little further out ... take a Ranger down, grab Miller and her samples, debrief and analyze back here

BRAND
That’ll work.
COOPER
No time for monkey business down there - Tars, you’d better wait up here. Who else?
ROMILLY
If we’re talking about a couple years - I’d use that time to work on gravity - observations from the wormhole. That’s gold to Professor Brand.

COOPER
Okay. Tars, factor an orbit of Gargantua - minimal thrusting - conserve fuel - but stay in range.
TARS
Don’t worry, I wouldn’t leave you behind ...
(Swivels around.) Dr Brand.
She smiles at him.
 

EXT. BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY
A black sphere sucking light from the cosmos, visible by its distorting effect on the light of stars behind it - squeezed into a GLOWING, CURVED HORIZON. The Endurance approaches.

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - DAY
Cooper looks out at Gargantua. Doyle peers over his shoulder
DOYLE
A literal heart of darkness ...
Brand points to a small glowing planet nearer the blackness.
BRAND
There’s Miller’s planet.
Cooper turns to Case, the machine riding shotgun.
COOPER
 
Ready? Yup.
 
CASE COOPER
 
Don’t say much, do you?
CASE
Tars talks plenty for both of us.
Cooper chuckles as he throws a final switch - COOPER
Detach -

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger DETACHES from the ring module, like an X-1 from a B-29, FIRES retro-thrusters to slow and ... DROPS -

EXT. THE BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY
The Ranger SHOOTS down towards Gargantua -
 

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is in awe at their acceleration -
COOPER
(into radio)
Romilly, you reading these forces?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Romilly studies data, marveling.
ROMILLY
Unbelievable.
(Looks out at Gargantua.)
If we could see the collapsed star inside, the singularity, we’d solve gravity.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks down at the eerie blackness sliding beneath -
COOPER
No way to get anything from it?
ROMILLY
(over radio)
Nothing escapes that horizon. Not even light. The answer’s there, just no way to see it.

EXT. GARGANTUA - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger looks tiny as it STREAKS over the blackness, high above the GLOWING HORIZON. It is approaching Miller’s planet, a gleaming dark-blue world ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper studies his trajectory.
CASE
This is fast for atmospheric entry. Should we use the thrusters to slow?
 

COOPER
We’re gonna use the Ranger’s aerodynamics to save the fuel.
CASE
Air brake?
COOPER
Wanna get in fast, don’t we?
CASE
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger STREAKS down towards the planet. It starts to encounter the STRATOSPHERE -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The craft starts to HOWL and SHAKE. Cooper studies the curving horizon, concentrating -
CASE
We should ease -
COOPER
Hands where I can see them, Case! Only time I ever went down was a machine easing at the wrong moment
-

CASE
A little caution -
COOPER
Can get you killed, same as reckless.

DOYLE
Cooper! Too damn fast!
COOPER
I got this.
Cooper squeezes the shaking controls with white knuckles -
CASE
Should I disable the feedback?
 

COOPER
No! No, I need to feel the air ...

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger glows WHITE HOT, slicing through FLAT CLOUDS -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper peers out at the razor-like layers of cloud -
COOPER
Do we have a fix on the beacon?
CASE
Got it. Can you maneuver?
COOPER
Gotta shave more speed. I’ll try and spiral down on it -
Doyle looks at Brand, nervous. She takes a breath.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger CUTS through cloud formations, BURSTING out into CLEARER AIR, HIGH ABOVE AN ENDLESS OCEAN -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The crew peer at SPARKLING WATER, streaking below them -
DOYLE
Just water.
BRAND
The stuff of life ...
CASE
Twelve hundred meters out.
Cooper BANKS sharply, eases down.
BRAND
It’s shallow. Feet deep ...
 

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger is low now, kicking up backwash -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
CASE
Seven hundred meters ...
Cooper peers ahead -

COOPER
Wait for it ...
CASE
Five hundred meters ...
Cooper YANKS the stick -
COOPER
Fire!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger’s retro-rockets FIRE - killing the craft’s speed just feet from the surface. Water SPRAYS UP as the Ranger SLEWS diagonally, gear is lowered, the Ranger drops, its landing gear holding it just above the shallow water.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Everyone BOUNCES with the impact. Then BREATHES.
BRAND
Very graceful.
COOPER
No. But it was very efficient. (Looks at them.)
What’re you waiting for? Go!
Brand and Doyle hurry out of their harnesses, helmets on. Case moves to the hatch. With a CRACK, the hatch opens and LIGHT and SPRAY whip inside ...
 

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
Case climbs quickly from the craft, knee deep in the water. Brand and Doyle follow. Case TRACKS the beacon.
CASE
This way, about two hundred meters.
Brand and Doyle peer into the distance. Smooth, ankle-deep water to the horizon, where a distant MOUNTAIN RANGE LOOMS. They start splashing towards it in their heavy spacesuits
...

DOYLE
(panting)
The gravity’s punishing ...
BRAND
Floating through space too long?
CASE
One hundred and thirty percent Earth gravity.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper listens to their chatter, IMPATIENT.
COOPER
(under his breath) Come on ...

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Doyle falls behind. Brand pushes on. Ahead, Case stops.
CASE
Should be here.
Brand joins him, searching the shallows for some sign of Miller’s mission. She looks up, confused.
BRAND
If the signal’s coming from here -
Case DROPS to his knees THRASHING under the water, like a bear fishing. Doyle arrives -
DOYLE
What’s he doing?
 

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper notices something. In the distance. The mountains -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Case WRENCHES a piece of DAMAGED EQUIPMENT from the sea bed.
BRAND
Her beacon ...
Case starts lugging the beacon to the Ranger.
DOYLE
Wreckage. Where’s the rest ...?
BRAND
Towards the mountains!
She starts moving fast towards some FLOATING OBJECTS.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is staring out at the horizon -
COOPER
Those aren’t mountains ...

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand pauses -

COOPER
(over radio) They’re waves -

Brand looks closer - the ’mountains’ are moving, tiny lines of white sea spray are blowing from the tops ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks the other direction ... there is a MOUNTAIN WAVE BEARING DOWN ON THE SHIP ...
 

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand is searching the wreckage -.
COOPER
(over radio) Brand, get back here!
BRAND
We need the recorder -
Doyle looks from Brand to Case, who is loading the beacon. Beyond him Doyle sees the mountain wave approaching -
DOYLE
Case, go get her!

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper hits the dash, frustrated.
COOPER
Dammit! Brand, get back here!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand sloshes along, checking DEBRIS -
BRAND
We can’t leave without her data -
COOPER
(over radio) You don’t have time!
Case is back at Doyle.
DOYLE
Go, go!
Case takes off towards Brand, who is trying to lift a piece of equipment from the water. She drops it and moves on -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper swings open the hatch, stands in the doorway, peering out at the approaching mountain waves - turns back to Brand
-
 
COOPER
Get back here! Now!
Brand has pulled something heavy from the wreckage - she SLIPS, the wreckage PINNING her down ... She looks back at the Ranger - sees the mountain wave THOUSANDS OF FEET HIGH ALMOST UPON THEM -

BRAND
Cooper, go! Go! I can’t make it!
Cooper looks at Case RACING towards her -
COOPER
Get up, Brand!
BRAND
GO! GET OUT OF HERE!
Case THROWS her onto his back and starts running. Doyle stands, mesmerized by the sheer liquid mountain face ...
COOPER
Doyle! Come on! Case has her!
Doyle turns, starts sloshing back, the water RUNNING against his ankles now ... Two hundred yards behind, Case POUNDS through the shallows, Brand on his back -

Cooper looks up at the EVER CLOSER MOUNTAIN WAVE - jumps inside.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper powers up, as the wall of liquid fills his view.
COOPER
Come on, come on ...
He sees the water right upon them - RUNS back to the hatch. Doyle is at the foot of the ladder, Case RUNNING FAST.
DOYLE
Go!
Case JUMPS up the ladder, THROWS Brand inside - TURNS for Doyle. The Ranger TILTS, RISES - DOYLE IS RIPPED FROM CASE’S HAND - WATER RAGES ACROSS THE OPEN HATCH -
COOPER
Shut the hatch!
Case shuts the hatch. Cooper is throwing switches -
 

COOPER
Power down! Power down! We have to ride it out!
(To Brand, furious.)
We are not prepared for this!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Doyle is DRAGGED under and away. The Ranger is SUCKED SIDEWAYS up the face of the mountain -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Cooper are thrown across the cockpit. Case GRABS Brand, pulls her into her seat - Cooper holds on as the craft ROLLS and ROLLS -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger reaches the top of the wave, rocks upright -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper drops into his seat as the water pours off the canopy
-

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger tilts over the backside of the wave, SURFING for a second then PITCHING FORWARD - TUMBLING DOWN 8,000 FEET
...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
They hang on for dear life, THRASHED MERCILESSLY -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger comes AGROUND as the wave leaves it behind ...
 
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The craft comes to rest. Cooper jumps to the controls, powers up the electrics. The engines won’t respond -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The gear LIFTS the Ranger. Water FLOODS out -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries the engines again. Nothing.
CASE
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
COOPER
(hits console) GODDAMN!

BRAND
I told you to leave me.
COOPER
And I told you to get your ass back here! Difference is, only one of us was thinking about the mission -
BRAND
Cooper, you were thinking about getting home - I was trying to do the right thing!
COOPER
Tell that to Doyle.
Quiet. Cooper looks down at the clock. Bitter.
How long to drain, Case?
CASE
Forty-five to an hour.
Cooper shakes his head. Pulls his helmet off.
COOPER
The stuff of life, huh? What’s this gonna cost us, Brand?
BRAND
A lot. Decades.
Cooper rubs his face. Mind reeling. Trying to breathe.
 

COOPER
What happened to Miller?
BRAND
Judging by the wreckage, she was broken up by a wave soon after impact.

COOPER
How could the wreckage still be together after all these years?
BRAND
Because of the time slippage. On this planet’s time, she landed here just hours ago. She might’ve only died minutes ago.
Case indicates the beacon.
CASE
The data Doyle received was just the initial status, echoing endlessly.
Cooper takes this in. Breathes hard. Takes off his gloves.
COOPER
We’re not prepared for this, Brand. You’re a bunch of eggheads without the survival skills of a boy-scout troop.

BRAND
We got this far on our brains - farther than any humans in history
-

COOPER
Not far enough. And we’re stuck here till there won’t be anyone left on Earth to save -
BRAND
I’m counting every second, same as you, Cooper.
Cooper takes this in. They’re in the same boat.
COOPER
Don’t you have some clever way we jump into a black hole and get back the years?
 

She shakes her head, dismissive.
COOPER
Don’t just shake your head at me -!
BRAND
Time is relative - it can stretch and squeeze - but it can’t run backwards. The only thing that can move across dimensions like time is gravity.

COOPER
(thinks)
The beings who led us here ... they communicate through gravity ...
Brand nods.
Could they be talking to us from the future?
BRAND
(considers) Maybe ...

COOPER
Well, if they can -
BRAND
Look, Cooper, they’re creatures of at least five dimensions - to them time may be just another physical dimension. To them the past might be a canyon they can climb into and the future a mountain they can can climb up ... but to us it’s not, okay?
Brand pulls her helmet off. Looks Cooper in the eyes.
BRAND
I’m sorry, Cooper. I screwed up. But you knew about relativity.
COOPER
My daughter was ten. I couldn’t explain Einstein’s theories before I left.

BRAND
Could you tell her you were going to save the world?
 

COOPER
No. I wasn’t much of a parent, but I understood the most important thing - let your kids feel safe.
Which rules out telling a
ten-year-old that the world’s ending.

 

Cooper?
 
CASE
 

Case is pointing out at another MOUNTAIN RANGE.
COOPER
How long for the engines?
CASE
A minute or two -
COOPER
We don’t have it!
The mountain wave is approaching. Cooper tries the engines -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The rockets COUGH and steam ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries the engines again. Close. But no ignition.
COOPER
Helmets on!
The wave is upon them ...
COOPER
Blow our cabin oxygen through the main thrusters. We’ll spark it -

Case hits a button - a HISS and SHRIEK of gas escaping ... Brand seals her helmet just as the cockpit DEPRESSURIZES -
COOPER
Come on, now ...
Cooper hits the engines - they BLAST TO LIFE -
 

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
A fiery BLAST sends the Ranger clear of the mountain wave.
Down below, Doyle’s body lies in the shallows, about to be swept up into the next rush of water ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Romilly watches as Cooper and Brand enter the Endurance.
BRAND
Hello, Rom.
ROMILLY
I’ve waited years.
COOPER
How many years?
ROMILLY
By now ... it must be -
TARS
Twenty-three years ...
Cooper’s head lowers.
TARS
... four months, eight days.
Cooper turns away.

 

Doyle?
 
ROMILLY
 

Brand’s eyes flicker down. She shakes her head. She grasps Romilly’s hands, looks up into his eyes, vulnerable -
BRAND
I thought I was prepared. I knew all the theory. Reality’s different.

ROMILLY
And Miller?
BRAND
There’s nothing here for us.
Brand looks at Romilly’s wrinkles. His greying beard.
 

BRAND
Why didn’t you sleep?
ROMILLY
I did a couple of stretches. But I stopped believing you were coming back, and something seems wrong about dreaming your life away. I learned what I could from studying the black hole, but I couldn’t send anything to your father. We’ve been receiving, but nothing gets out.
She looks up at Romilly, not wanting to ask ...
BRAND
Is he still alive?
Romilly nods. Brand closes her eyes with relief.
ROMILLY
We’ve got years of messages stored
...
Brand opens her eyes, looks for Cooper. He is in the comm. booth. He SHUTS the privacy curtain. She looks down.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper studies the machine like it might bite him.
COOPER
Cooper.
COMPUTER VOICE
Messages span twenty-three years -
COOPER
I know.
(Whispers.)
Just start at the beginning.
Cooper leans forward as the screen flickers to life: Tom, still seventeen, turns on the camera.
TOM
Hi, Dad -
Cooper pauses it. Prepares himself. Lets it run -
 
TOM
I met another girl, Dad. I really think this is the one -
Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
Murph stole Grandpa’s car. She crashed it - she’s okay, though. Your truck’s still running - Grandpa said she should steal that next time. I said if she did it’d be the last thing she did ...
Cooper leans back ...

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - DAY
Cooper is holed up, still watching, unshaved. He’s been watching for days. On the screen, Tom is in his twenties -
TOM
I’ve got a surprise for you, Dad. You’re a grandpa ...
Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling.
Congratulations. Meet Jesse.
Cooper smiles a tearful smile.
Grandpa said he already earned the ’great’ part so we just leave it at that.
The screen cuts out. Then comes back on. Tom in his thirties
-
Hi, Dad. I’m sorry it’s been awhile. What with Jesse and all ...
He stops, emotional.
Grandpa died last week. We buried him out in the back forty, next to Mom and Jesse.
(Looks down.)
Where we’d have buried you, if you’d ever come back.
(Looks up.)
Murph was there for the funeral. I don’t see her so much anymore.
(Sighs.)
You’re not listening to this. I know that. All these messages are just out there, drifting in the darkness ... I figured as long as they were willing to send them there was some hope, but ...
 

(Pauses.)
You’re gone. You’re never coming back. And I’ve known that for a long time. Lois says - that’s my wife, Dad - she says I have to let you go. So I am.
(Reaches up to turn off camera.)
Wherever you are, I hope you’re at peace. Goodbye, Dad.

The screen goes black. Tears are streaming down Cooper’s face. He stares at the black screen, wiping his face. He starts to get up - the screen flickers to life once more -

A beautiful WOMAN of about forty has turned on the camera - she looks at us, unsure about this. Makes a start -
WOMAN
Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
Cooper peers into the face, recognizing -
COOPER
(whispers) Murph?

WOMAN (MURPH)
I never made one of these when you were still responding cos I was so mad at you for leaving. When you went quiet, it seemed like I should just live with my decision. And I have ...
(Looks around.)
But today’s my birthday. And it’s a special one because you once told me -
She stops, unable to speak for a second.
MURPH
You once told me that when you came back we might be the same age ... and today I’m the age you were when you left ...
(Starts crying.)
So it’d be a real good time for you to come back.

Murph reaches up, switches off the camera and we stay with her in -
 
INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY
Murph brings her hand down from the camera. Wipes her tears.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(O.S., softly)
I didn’t mean to intrude.
Murph turns to see Professor Brand, now ELDERLY, in a WHEELCHAIR in the doorway.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’ve never seen you in here before.
Murph rises -

MURPH
I’ve never been in here before.
Murph wheels Professor Brand out into the corridor.

INT. CURVING CORRIDOR, NASA - MOMENTS LATER
Murph pushes Professor Brand.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps. I’m glad you’ve started -
MURPH
I haven’t. I just had something I wanted to get out.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Professor Brand wheels behind his desk.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I know they’re still out there.
MURPH
I know.
PROFESSOR BRAND
There are so many reasons their communications might not be getting through.

MURPH
(smiles gently) I know, Professor.
 

PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m not sure which I’m more afraid of ... they never come back, or they come back to find we’ve failed.
She watches his introspection. Brings him back with -
MURPH
Then let’s succeed.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(gestures at formula)
So, back from the fourth iteration, let’s run it with a finite set.
Murph has picked up a notebook. Pauses.
MURPH
With respect, Professor. We’ve tried that hundreds of times.
PROFESSOR BRAND
And it only has to work once, Murph.
She shrugs. Starts to work.

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - LATER
Murph and Professor Brand sit, eating sandwiches on a walkway. WORKERS move about the CIRCULAR CHAMBER, building more SIDEWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE. Professor Brand looks down, proud.

PROFESSOR BRAND
Every rivet they drive in could have been a bullet. We’ve done well for the world, here. Whether or not we crack the equation before I kick
-

MURPH
Don’t be morbid, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m not afraid of death, Murph. I’m an old physicist - I’m afraid of time.
 

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Murph stands before the algebra. She REALIZES something.
MURPH
Time ... you’re afraid of time ...
CONVINCED, she TURNS -
Professor, the equation ...?
He looks up.
For years we’ve tried to solve it without changing the underlying assumptions about time -
PROFESSOR BRAND
And?
MURPH
And that means each iteration becomes an attempt to prove its own proof - it’s recursive. Nonsensical
-

PROFESSOR BRAND
(sharp)
Are you calling my life’s work ’nonsense’, Murph?
MURPH
No, I’m saying you’ve been trying to finish it with one arm - no, with both arms tied behind your back ...
Murph focuses on Professor Brand, suddenly WARY ...
... and I don’t understand why.
Professor Brand looks down. Starts wheeling his chair.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m an old man, Murph. Could we pick this up some other time? I’d like to go talk to my daughter.
Murph nods. Looking at the Professor. Confused.
PROFESSOR BRAND (V.O.)
Stepping out into the universe, we must first confront the reality that nothing in our solar system can help us ...
 

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - NIGHT
Brand watches her father on screen.
PROFESSOR BRAND (V.O.)
... then we must confront the realities of interstellar travel. We must venture far beyond the reach of our own life spans. We must think not as individuals, but as a species ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Romilly, Brand, Cooper, Tars and Case sit in discussion.
COOPER
Tars kept the Endurance right where we needed her, but it took years longer than we anticipated ...

Cooper puts both planets on screen - Dr Mann’s ice world, and Edmunds’ desert planet.
COOPER
We don’t have the fuel to visit both prospects. We have to choose.
ROMILLY
How? They’re both promising. Edmunds’ data was better, but Dr Mann is the one still transmitting.
BRAND
We’ve got no reason to suppose Edmunds’ results would have soured. His world has key elements to sustain human life -
COOPER
As does Dr Mann’s.
BRAND
Cooper, this is my field. And I really believe Edmunds’ is the better prospect.
COOPER
(challenging)
Why?
 

BRAND
Gargantua, that’s why. (Steps to board.)
Look at Miller’s world - hydrocarbons, organics, yes. But no life. Sterile. We’ll find the same thing on Dr Mann’s.
ROMILLY
Because of the black hole?
BRAND
(nods)
Murphy’s Law - whatever can happen will happen. Accident is the first building block of evolution - but when you’re orbiting a black hole not enough can happen - it sucks in asteroids and comets, random events that would otherwise reach you. We need to go to further afield.
COOPER
You once referred to Dr Mann as the ’best of us’.
BRAND
He’s remarkable. We’re only here because of him.
COOPER
And he’s there on the ground sending an unambiguous message that we should go to that planet.
Brand is silent. Romilly looks from Brand to Cooper.
ROMILLY
Should we vote?
COOPER
If we’re going to vote, there’s something you need to know. Brand?
She says nothing.
He has a right to know.
BRAND
That has nothing to do with it.
ROMILLY
What does?
 
COOPER
She’s in love with Wolf Edmunds.
ROMILLY
(to Brand) Is that true?
BRAND
Yes. And that makes me want to follow my heart. But maybe we’ve spent too long trying to figure all this with theory -
COOPER
You’re a scientist, Brand -
BRAND
I am. So listen to me when I tell you that love isn’t something we invented - it’s observable, powerful. Why shouldn’t it mean something?

COOPER
It means social utility - child rearing, social bonding -
BRAND
We love people who’ve died ... where’s the social utility in that? Maybe it means more - something we can’t understand, yet. Maybe it’s some evidence, some artifact of higher dimensions that we can’t consciously perceive. I’m drawn across the universe to someone I haven’t seen for a decade, who I know is probably dead. Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can’t yet understand it.
Brand looks at Romilly, who can’t meet her eye.
BRAND
Cooper, yes - the tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me. But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.
Cooper thinks back to his conversation with Donald.
 

COOPER
Honestly, Amelia ... it might.
Romilly looks at Brand. It’s clear she’s lost.
COOPER
Tars, set the course for Dr Mann.
Brand is starting to tear up. She turns away.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER
The thrusters FIRE, pushing the Endurance out of its orbit of Gargantua.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
Brand is checking her POPULATION BOMB. Cooper enters.
COOPER
Brand, I’m sorry.
BRAND
Why? You’re just being objective. (Beat.)
Unless you’re punishing me for screwing up on Miller’s planet.
COOPER
This wasn’t a personal decision for me.
Brand turns from her equipment. Looks him in the eye.
BRAND
Well, if you’re wrong, you’ll have a very personal decision to make.
(Off look.)
Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey. Strike out on Dr Mann’s planet, and we’ll have to decide whether to return home, or push on to Edmunds’ planet with Plan B. Starting a colony could save us from extinction.
She closes the population bomb.
You might have to decide between seeing your children again ... and the future of the human race.
(Smiles bitterly.)
(MORE)
 
BRAND (cont’d)
I trust you’ll be as objective, then.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance sinks past a GLORIOUS NEBULA whose GOLDEN MISTS DISSOLVE TO ROILING BLACK CLOUDS and we are -

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph stands with Tom, now late forties. Watching a field BURN.

TOM
We’ll lose about a third this season. But next year ... I’m gonna start working Nelson’s fields.
Should make it up.
MURPH
What happened to Nelson?
Tom glances at her. Don’t ask. Heads for the house.

INT./EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK
Murph at family dinner with Tom, LOIS, and their six-year-old son COOP.
LOIS
Will you stay the night? We left your room like it was ...
Murph looks down, awkward ...
MURPH
No, I need to ...
Murph looks upstairs. At Lois.
Too many memories, Lois.
She nods. Coop helps Tom clear. As Coop takes Murph’s plate he starts COUGHING. Looks up at her, sees her concern, GRINS.

 

The dust.
 
COOP
 

He and Tom head into the kitchen.
 

MURPH
I have a friend who should look at his lungs, Lois.
She nods, is about to speak. Tom sits back down.
Pull back to reveal the glowing windows against the darkening plain, dust clouds rolling across the horizon ...

INT. CORRIDOR, NASA - NIGHT
Murph hurries down a corridor with a doctor, GETTY.
GETTY
He started asking for you after he came to, but we couldn’t raise you
-

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NASA - MOMENTS LATER
Murph is at Professor Brand’s bedside. He is hooked up to machines. Barely breathing.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Murph ... Murph ...
Murph takes his hand with gentle concern.
MURPH
I’m here, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I don’t have much life ... (Breathes.)
I have to tell you ...
MURPH
Try to take it easy.
PROFESSOR BRAND
All these ... years. All these people ... counted on me ...
MURPH
It’s okay, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I let you ... all you ... down.
 

MURPH
No. I’ll finish what you started.
Professor Brand looks up into Murph’s eyes, tears welling.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Murph. Good, good Murph. Such faith
... all these years, I told you to have faith ... to believe ...
MURPH
I do believe -
PROFESSOR BRAND
I needed you to believe your father was coming back ...
MURPH
I do, Professor -
PROFESSOR BRAND
Forgive me, Murph ...
MURPH
There’s nothing to forgive.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I lied, Murph. I lied to you ...
Murph looks at Professor Brand, confused.
PROFESSOR BRAND
There’s no reason to come back ... no way to help us ...
MURPH
But Plan A - all this - all these people ... the equation!

But Professor Brand slowly shakes his head, tears rolling down. As Murph tries to comprehend, he settles, DRIFTING.
MURPH
(whispers) Did he know?

 
Nothing. Nothing.
 

Did my dad know?! Did he abandon me?!
 

PROFESSOR BRAND
Do ... not ... go...
She leans in to hear.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Gentle ... into ... into ...
MURPH
NO! NO! Professor, stay! You can’t! You can’t leave ...
Getty is at her shoulder.
MURPH
You can’t, you can’t, you ...
Getty puts his hand on her shoulder. She sits there. Stuck. As Professor Brand goes still ...

MURPH (V.O.)
Dr Brand, I’m sorry to tell you that your father died today ...

INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY
Murph, controlled anger, sits in front of the camera. MURPH
He had no pain and was ... at peace. I’m sorry for your loss.
She reaches to switch off the camera. STOPS. Acid.
Did you know, Brand? Did he tell you ...?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Murph’s voice rings through the empty ship. Only Case there to register it.

MURPH (V.O.)
Did you know that Plan A was a sham
...?! You left us here. To die. Never coming back ...
Through the window we see the Ranger moving away, towards -
 
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
The Endurance orbits the silvery white globe as the Ranger heads towards the planet.

EXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER
The Ranger drops through layers of large, MOUNTAINOUS CLOUD.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Tars, Brand and Romilly. Cooper peers out, concerned, studying a heads-up display of CLOUD DENSITY ...

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger cuts through one cloud, banks left and SCRAPES AGAINST THE NEXT ’CLOUD’, PANELS TEARING FROM THE WING - THE CLOUDS ARE ACTUALLY SOLID ICE FORMATIONS ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper banks away from the ICE, glancing out at the damage -

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger moves cautiously through the ’cloudscape’ like a ship through an ice field ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Romilly and Brand put their helmets on. Tars indicates the beacon’s position. Cooper looks, BANKS the Ranger.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger’s gear lowers as it comes to rest, tentatively, at the base of what looks like a large CUMULUS CLOUD.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER
Cooper leads them up the ICE CLOUD. From a distance, they are walking on a cloud. Tars brings up the rear.

Cooper crests a ridge. SPOTS something. He starts down towards a dirty orange dot in the cloudscape.
 

EXT. DR MANN’S POD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper is there. The others arrive at the large metal pod - WEATHERED and DAMAGED over the years, half buried in ice.
Nearby, various WIRE MARKERS stick out of the ice. Tars starts digging out the hatch.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER
A CRACK of COLD LIGHT, as the outer hatch is wrenched open. Cooper steps through the airlock, into a CRYPT-LIKE SPACE -

Cooper’s hand sweeps ice from the nameplate of a cryo-chamber, ’DR MANN’.
Tars fires up the cryo-chamber. The ice starts to melt.
Cooper, helmet off, CRACKS the lid, pushes it back, revealing a figure in a plastic shroud. Cooper rips the seal
...
Dr Mann’s eyes flicker open. He watches Cooper, breathing, focusing - reaches up with TREMBLING hands - GRABS Cooper - PULLS himself up, CHEEK AGAINST CHEEK - SOBBING - hands desperately CARESSING Cooper’s face. Cooper holds him tight.
COOPER
(whispering) It’s okay. It’s okay.

INT. SAME - LATER
Dr Mann sits, blanket over his shoulders, sipping from a steaming cup. He looks at their faces, marveling.
DR MANN
(cracked, parched)
Pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face.
(Shaky sip.)
I hadn’t much hope to begin with. After so much time, I had none. My supplies were exhausted. The last time I went to sleep, I set no waking date.
(Looks at them all.)
You have literally raised me from the dead.
 
COOPER
(smiles) Lazarus.

DR MANN
(nods) And the others?
ROMILLY
I’m afraid you’re it, sir.
DR MANN
So far, surely?
COOPER
With our situation, there’s not much hope of any other rescue.
This hits Dr Mann hard. He looks down at his tea.
BRAND
Dr Mann, tell us about your world.
DR MANN
(smiles gently)
My world. Yes. Our world, we hope. Our world is cold, stark ...

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Dr Mann leads the others up to the summit of a cloud.
DR MANN (V.O.)
But undeniably beautiful ...
From the top, they watch the planet’s pale sun setting.
DR MANN
The days are sixty-seven cold hours, the nights are sixty-seven far colder hours ...
They make their way back into the shelter.
DR MANN (V.O.)
The gravity is a very pleasant 80 percent of Earth’s. Up here, where I landed, the ’water’ is alkali and the ’air’ has too much ammonia in it to breathe for more than a few minutes ...
 
Brand checks readings on Dr Mann’s instruments.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - NIGHT
The crew are captivated by Dr Mann ...
DR MANN
But down at the surface, and there is a surface ... the chlorine dissipates and the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air. To organics.
Possibly even to life. (Off looks.)
Yes. We may be sharing this world.
BRAND
(giddy)
These readings are from the surface?
Brand is reviewing Dr Mann’s piles of data.
DR MANN
Over the years I’ve dropped various probes.

COOPER
How far have you explored?
DR MANN
I’ve mounted several major expeditions, but with oxygen in limited supply, Kipp there had to do most of the legwork.
Dr Mann indicates a DEFUNCT ARTICULATED MACHINE.
TARS
What’s wrong with him?
DR MANN
Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals. We struggled on for a time, but ultimately, I decommissioned him and used his power source to keep the mission going.
(Remembers, sadly.)
I thought I was alone before I shut him down.
 

TARS
Would you like me to look at him?
DR MANN
No, I think he needs a human touch.
Tars turns to Brand.

 




She nods.
 
TARS
Dr Brand, Case is relaying a message for you from the comm. station.
 

MURPH (V.O.)
... He had no pain and was ... at peace.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER
Brand watches Murph’s message on Tars’ data screen.
MURPH
I’m sorry for your loss.
Brand STARES. Cooper is there. Murph reaches up -
BRAND
(abstract) Is that Murph?
Cooper nods.
She’s become a -
MURPH
(acid)
Did you know, Brand? Did he tell you? That Plan A was a sham ...?!
Cooper looks at Brand, who is shocked.
You left us here to set up your colony. Never coming back ...

Murph does not want to ask, tears are running down her cheeks -
(Small.)
Did my father know? Dad ...?
Cooper stares. Murph’s eyes bore into his ...
Did you leave me here to die?
 

The screen goes dark. Cooper stands there, SHOCKED.
BRAND
Cooper, my father devoted his whole life to Plan A - I have no idea what she means -

DR MANN (O.S.)
I do.
They turn. Dr Mann looks at them with gentle calm.
COOPER
He never even hoped to get people off the Earth.
DR MANN
No.
BRAND
But he’s been trying to solve the gravity equation for forty years!
Dr Mann comes over, looks into Brand’s eyes.
DR MANN
Amelia, your father solved his equation before I even left.
BRAND
Then why wouldn’t he use it?!
DR MANN
The equation couldn’t reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics. You need more -
COOPER
More what?!
DR MANN
More data. You need to see inside a black hole. And the laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
COOPER
(to Romilly) Is that true?
ROMILLY
If a black hole is an oyster, the singularity is the pearl inside.
(MORE)
 

ROMILLY (cont’d)
Its gravity is so strong, it’s always hidden in darkness, behind the horizon. That’s why we call it a black hole.
COOPER
If we could look beyond the horizon
-

DR MANN
Some things aren’t meant to be known.
(To Brand.)
Your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction. Plan B. A colony.
BRAND
Why not tell people? Why keep building that damn station?
DR MANN
He knew how much harder it would be for people to come together and save the species, instead of themselves ...
(To Cooper, sympathetic.) Or their children.
COOPER
Bullshit.
DR MANN
Would you have left if you hadn’t believed you were trying to save them? Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier - we can care deeply, selflessly for people we know, but our empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

BRAND
But the lie. A monstrous lie ...
DR MANN
Unforgivable. And he knew it. Your father was prepared to destroy his own humanity to save our species. He made the ultimate sacrifice.
 

COOPER
No. That’s being made by the people of Earth who’ll die because, in his arrogance, he declared their case hopeless.

DR MANN
I’m sorry, Cooper. Their case is hopeless. We are the future.
Cooper REELS. Brand puts her hand on his shoulder -
BRAND
Cooper, what can I do?
He turns to her. Looks her in the eyes.
COOPER
Let me go home.
And the sound of WIND in DRY CORNSTALKS takes us -

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAWN
Murph drives. Getty next to her. In the distance, several fields BURN.

GETTY
Are you sure?
MURPH
His solution was correct. He’d had it for years.
GETTY
It’s worthless?
MURPH
It’s half the answer.
GETTY
How do you find the other half?
Murph points at the sky.
MURPH
Out there? A black hole. Stuck here on Earth? I’m not sure you can.
They pass vehicles PILED HIGH with belongings and people.
 

GETTY
They just pack up and leave. What are they hoping to find?
MURPH
Survival.
(Looks ahead.) Dammit!

A DUST STORM SWAMPS the truck, killing visibility. Murph pulls over. Kills the engine. The wind rocks the car.
GETTY
Don’t people have a right to know?
MURPH
Panic won’t help. We have to keep working, same as ever.
GETTY
Isn’t that just what Professor Brand ...?

MURPH
(sharp)
Brand gave up on us - I’m still trying to solve this.
GETTY
So you have an idea?
MURPH
No. I have a ... feeling.
Getty looks at her as she STARES out at the dust.
INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN), wet hair, towel around neck, turns and STARES at a book on the floor -

MURPH (V.O.)
I told you about my ghost ...
She stoops to pick up the toy next to it - a broken LUNAR LANDER.

MURPH (FORTY) puts her hands on the glass, watching the sand scrape the car’s window ...
MURPH
My dad thought I called it a ghost because I was scared of it ...
 

INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN) counts the books and gaps. MARVELING.

MURPH (V.O.)
But I was never scared of it ...
MURPH (TEN) takes out her notebook and starts drawing lines to represent the books.

MURPH (V.O.)
I called it a ghost because it felt like ...
MURPH (FORTY) turns to Getty.
MURPH
Like a person. Trying to tell me something ...
The storm is clearing. Murph starts the engine.
If there’s an answer here on Earth, it’s back there, somehow. No one’s coming to save us.
(Pulls out.)
I have to find it ...
Murph pulls past a pickup piled with worldly goods and people. She makes eye contact with two filthy kids in the back ...
And we’re running out of time.

EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAWN
Tars is up on the wing of the Ranger. Case pilots the LANDER in to land near the Ranger.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is sitting with his feet on the console.
CASE
(over radio)
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

COOPER
They can stay. I’ll sleep most of the journey.
(Wry.)
(MORE)
 

COOPER (cont’d)
I saw it all on the way out here.
Romilly comes through the airlock. Removes his helmet.
ROMILLY
I have a suggestion for your return journey.

 

What?
 
COOPER

ROMILLY
 
Have one last crack at the black hole ...
Tars enters.

ROMILLY
Gargantua’s an older, spinning black hole - what we call a gentle singularity.
COOPER
Gentle?
ROMILLY
They’re hardly gentle, but their tidal gravity is quick enough that something crossing the horizon fast might survive ... a probe, say.
COOPER
What happens to it after it crosses?

ROMILLY
Beyond the horizon is a complete mystery - who’s to say there isn’t some way the probe can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data? If he’s equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse
- X-ray, visible light, radio -
TARS
Just when did this probe become a ’he’?
Romilly looks from Tars to Cooper, sheepish.
 
ROMILLY
Tars is the obvious candidate. I’ve already told him what to look for.
TARS
I’d need to take the old optical transmitter from Kipp.
COOPER
(to Tars)
You’d do this for us?
TARS
Before you get teary, try to remember that as a robot I have to do anything you say, anyway.
COOPER
Your cue light’s broken.
TARS
I’m not joking.
Bing. The light flashes on.

EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Brand and Dr Mann approach Cooper and Romilly at the foot of the ladder. Cooper addresses Brand -
COOPER
Ranger’s almost ready. Case is on his way back down with another load.

BRAND
I’ll start a final inventory.
ROMILLY
Dr Mann, I need Tars to remove and adapt some components from Kipp.
Dr Mann considers this. Looks at Tars. At Romilly.
DR MANN
He musn’t disturb Kipp’s archival functions.

ROMILLY
I’ll supervise.
Dr Mann considers this. Nods.
 
COOPER
We need to pick out a site. You don’t wanna move the module once we land it.

DR MANN
I’ll show you the probe sites.
Cooper glances around at the winds picking up - COOPER
Will conditions hold?
DR MANN
These squalls usually blow over. You’ve got a long-range transmitter?
Cooper reaches up to check a box plugged in at his neck.
COOPER
Good to go.
Dr Mann points at a nozzle on his elbow -
DR MANN
Charged?
Cooper checks, thumbs up. Dr Mann sets off, Cooper follows.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER
As Cooper follows Dr Mann down a ridge, they see the lander fly over. Cooper waves, reaches up to his long-range transmitter -

COOPER
A little caution, Case?
CASE
(over radio) Safety first, Cooper.

Cooper follows Dr Mann down to the edge of the ice. They peer down a fifty-foot drop.
DR MANN
Just take it gently -
He steps off, DROPPING - his ELBOW JETS FIRE, slowing his descent in time for him to land with a THUD. Cooper follows.
They set out through a massive CANYON of ice ...
 

DR MANN
Brand told me why you feel you have to go back -
Cooper STOPS.

COOPER
If this excursion is about trying to change my mind, let’s turn around right now.
DR MANN
No. I understand your position.
He turns and starts walking. Cooper follows.
DR MANN
You have attachments. I’m not supposed to, but even without family, I can promise you that the yearning to be with other people is massively powerful. Our instincts, our emotions, are at the foundations of what makes us human. They’re not to be taken lightly.
The wind WHIPS ice crystals between them ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph introduces Getty to Lois and Coop. Getty pulls out a STETHOSCOPE and starts examining Coop, Murph slips upstairs
...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - DAY
Murph opens the door. Stands in her old bedroom. Feeling ...
COOP (O.S.)
Mama lets me play in here ...
Murph turns to see Coop. He points at a box on the shelf - I don’t touch your stuff.
 

EXT. LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Brand turns away as the lander touches down in a spray of ice.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS
Romilly watches Tars crouch down beside Kipp and connect Kipp to his own power. Kipp shows signs of life ...

EXT. ICE CANYON, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Dr Mann waits for Cooper catch up. The WIND is picking up -
DR MANN
You know why we couldn’t just send machines on these missions, Cooper?
COOPER
(breathless) Frankly, no.
DR MANN
(pressing on)
A trip into the unknown requires improvisation. Machines can’t improvise well because you can’t program a fear of death. The survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration.
Dr Mann pauses to take a breath. Turns to Cooper.
Take you - a father. With a survival instinct that extends to your kids ...
COOPER
That’s why I’m going home, hopeless or not.

DR MANN
And what does research tell us is the last thing you’ll see before you die?
(Off look.)
Your children. At the very moment of death, your mind pushes you a little harder to survive. For them.

Dr Mann turns and starts walking out onto a massive ice field.
 

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph brings Coop downstairs. Getty is listening to Lois’ back. He looks up at Murph. GRAVE. Shakes his head ...
GETTY
They can’t stay here.
TOM (O.S.)
Murph?
Murph turns to see Tom in the doorway.
What is this ...?

EXT. LANDER, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand is counting flight cases when a WIND whips ice at her
...

INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS
Romilly takes his helmet off, PEERING over Tars’ shoulder at Kipp’s data screen. Confused.
ROMILLY
I don’t understand.

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Dr Mann are like two ants on a sheet.
DR MANN
The first window’s up ahead -
Cooper peers ahead to an OPENING in the ice. Dr Mann stops at the edge. Looks around the wind-blasted ice plane.
When I left Earth I felt fully prepared to die. But I just never faced the possibility that my planet wouldn’t be the one. None of this turned out the way it was supposed to.
COOPER
Professor Brand would disagree.
Cooper peers over the edge at an enormous CREVASSE ...
Dr Mann RIPS COOPER’S LONG-RANGE TRANSMITTER FROM HIS NECK -
 

Cooper TURNS to Dr Mann - who BLASTS him with his ELBOW JET. He SLIPS backwards, but avoids going over the edge -
COOPER
What are you doing?!
Until Dr Mann KICKS him. Cooper hits his jets, pushing himself onto a lower ledge of ice -

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Tom confronts Murph while Getty looks on -
MURPH
They can’t stay here, Tom!
GETTY
Not one more day -
Tom TURNS, PUNCHES Getty - who collapses.
LOIS
Tom?!
TOM
Coop, get your aunt’s things - she’s done here.
MURPH
Tom, Dad didn’t raise you this dumb
-

TOM
Dad didn’t raise us, Grandpa did, and he’s buried outside with Mom in our ground. I’m not leaving them -
MURPH
You have to, Tom -
TOM
I’m a farmer, Murph! You don’t give up on the Earth.
MURPH
No! But she gave up on you! And she’s poisoning your family.
 

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Cooper SCRAMBLES to his knees. Dr Mann approaches -
DR MANN
I’m sorry - I can’t let you leave.
COOPER
Why?!
DR MANN
We’re going to need your ship to continue the mission ... once the others realize what this place isn’t.
Cooper’s mind races. He looks around.
COOPER
You faked all the data?
DR MANN
I had a lot of time.
COOPER
Is there even a surface?
DR MANN
I’m afraid not -
Dr Mann KICKS Cooper over the edge, Cooper CLINGS on -
DR MANN
I tried to do my duty, Cooper, but the day I arrived I could see this place had nothing. I resisted the temptation for years ... but I knew there was a way to get rescued.
COOPER
You fucking coward.
Cooper BLASTS Dr Mann off his feet with his jet - SCRAMBLES up onto the ice. Dr Mann TACKLES him, they go down, WRESTLING. WIDER shows us two TINY FIGURES in a VAST LANDSCAPE, deciding the future of humanity with a BRAWL ...
 

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph begs Tom -

MURPH
Please, come with us.
TOM
To live underground, praying Dad comes back to save us all?
MURPH
He’s not coming back. He was never coming back. It’s up to us. To me.
TOM
You’re gonna save the human race, Murph? Really? How? Our dad couldn’t -

MURPH
HE DIDN’T EVEN TRY!
(Off look.)
He just abandoned us, Tom.
Murph looks around, frustrated. Coop hands Murph the box.
MURPH
Tom, if you won’t come, let them -
TOM
Murph.
(Points at box.)
Take your stuff, and go. Murph hands the box back to Coop.
MURPH
Keep it.
She leaves. Getty follows.

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Dr Mann LUNGES at Cooper, who SIDESTEPS him and PINS him ...
COOPER
Stop this!
Dr Mann HEADBUTTS COOPER, FACEPLATE IMPACTS FACEPLATE.
 
COOPER
Mann! Don’t - you’ll kill us both -
CRACK. Dr Mann SMASHES his helmet into Cooper’s AGAIN AND AGAIN as he -

DR MANN
SOMEONE’S - GLASS - WILL - GIVE - WAY - FIRST -!
COOPER
FIFTY-FIFTY YOU KILL YOUR SELF! STOP!

Dr Mann STOPS. Looks up at Cooper, BREATHING. Both faceplates have TINY FRACTURES ...
DR MANN
Best odds I’ve had in years -
WHACK - He BUTTS Cooper’s faceplate, which CRACKS SICKENINGLY. AMMONIA HISSES INSIDE - COOPER ROLLS OFF, HANDS UP, DESPERATELY TRYING TO PLUG THE LARGE CRACK -

Dr Mann RISES. Checks the fractures in his own helmet. Bends down to look at Cooper, STRUGGLING, CHOKING -
DR MANN
Please don’t judge me, Cooper - you were never tested like I was. Few men have been ...

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAY
Murph drives. Getty looks over, sympathetic.
GETTY
You did your best, Murph.
She just stares ahead at the road ...

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
With curiosity and FEAR, Dr Mann watches Cooper CRAWL ...
DR MANN
You’re feeling it, aren’t you? That survival instinct - that’s what drove me. It’s always driven the human race, and it’s going to save it now. I’m going to save it. For all mankind. For you, Cooper.
 
Unable to watch any more, he RISES, walking away, continuing to talk to Cooper via the radio ...
DR MANN
I’m sorry, I can’t watch you go through this - I thought I could. But I’m still here. I’m here for you ...
Dr Mann, hurrying away, listens to Cooper RASPING -
DR MANN
Cooper. When you left, did Professor Brand read you that poem? How does it end ...?
Dr Mann hauls himself up a ledge. The wind WHIPS up ice.
DR MANN
(over radio)
’Do not go gentle ...’
Cooper FREEZES. REMEMBERS. TRANSMITTER ...
DR MANN
(over radio)
’... into that good night ...’
Cooper LOOKS around - on the ice ten feet away - the TRANSMITTER -

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAY

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Cooper CRAWLS - CRAWLS - CHOKING - CRAWLING ...
Dr Mann leap/jets up onto the higher ice - glances back at the floundering figure on the ice with pity and awe.
DR MANN
(whispers)
Cooper ...? Do you see your children, yet?
 
Dr Mann hears only CHOKING, GASPING, HACKING. He kills his radio. Scared. Watches Cooper’s silent thrashing. TURNS.

Cooper GRABS the transmitter - tries to calm his FRANTIC HANDS - can’t reconnect it with clumsy gloves - pulls glove off - FREEZING - BITING - WAKING - he gets the connector IN

Through WATERING EYES and WIND-WHIPPED ICE, Cooper glimpses Brand LEAPING from the lander, elbow jets firing. Brand RIPS Cooper’s helmet off - THRUSTS an OXYGEN MASK over his nose and mouth. Cooper GASPS, SUCKING AIR HARD -

COOPER MANN - WAS - MANN -

Tars turns back from Kipp.
TARS
It needs a person to unlock its archival function.

Tars makes way for Romilly, who leans in to the screen. He glances at his helmet - the radio is SQUAWKING. As he reaches for his helmet, he places his hand on the screen - Kipp FLICKERS TO LIFE ... Romilly lifts his helmet -

Cooper stares out at the Ranger -
COOPER
Is he locked on?

Imperfectly.
Cooper grabs the transmitter -
COOPER
Dr Mann! Dr Mann! Do not, repeat do not attempt to open the hatch! If you -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
In SILENCE Dr Mann looks through the hatch window. Hits the button opening the outer door -

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The outer door of the Ranger SLIDES OPEN. Several grapples are OPENING AND CLOSING BLINDLY, trying to seal the join -
 

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks at Case -
COOPER
What happens if he blows the hatch?
CASE
Nothing good.
COOPER
Pull us back!
Case hits the retro-thrusters.
BRAND
Case, relay my transmission to his onboard computer, and have it rebroadcast as emergency p.a. -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Silence. Dr Mann takes a breath, reaches for the inner lever

BRAND
(over radio)
--PEAT - DO NOT OPEN INNER HATCH!
Dr Mann is STARTLED by the voice. He hits the transmitter -
DR MANN
Brand, I don’t know what Cooper’s told you, but I’m taking control of the Endurance, then we’ll talk about continuing the mission. This is not my survival, or Cooper’s - this is mankind’s -
Turns back to the lever ... PULLS IT -
A DEVASTATING RUSH OF AIR YANKS HIM INTO THE AIRLOCK -
 

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The ESCAPING AIR AND DEBRIS push Endurance into a slow SPIN
...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Dr Mann is HAMMERED by debris as the airlock starts to RIP APART -

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The ship SPINS FASTER AND FASTER - the Ranger is RIPPED AWAY, FRAGMENTING, SHREDDING THE CLOSEST MODULE OF THE RING.

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
They STARE in HORROR as their ship is sent SPINNING OFF ITS ORBIT TOWARDS THE PLANET -
BRAND
Oh, my God.
Cooper GRABS the sticks - HITS the thrusters -

EXT. ORBIT, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The CRIPPLED Endurance is in a FAST FLAT SPIN, heading down towards the stratosphere -
The lander FLIES after it, DODGING the Ranger debris -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper’s eyes are glued to the Endurance as he flies -
CASE
Cooper, there’s no point using our fuel to -

COOPER
Just analyze the Endurance’s spin -

What’re you doing?!
 

 

Docking.
 
COOPER
 

EXT. ORBIT, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The DIZZYING SPIN of the Endurance as it PLUMMETS towards the ATMOSPHERE - The lander ROCKETS after it, CLOSING SLOWLY

Cooper pours on the power -
CASE
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM -
COOPER
Get ready to match it on the retro-thrusters -
CASE
It’s not possible -
COOPER
No. It’s necessary.

EXT. ORBIT, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The SPINNING ENDURANCE starts to encounter the STRATOSPHERE

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Brand looks ahead at the spinning ship -
CASE
Endurance is hitting stratosphere -
BRAND
She’s got no heat shield -!
Cooper checks the lander’s speed against Endurance - pulls back on thrust as they come in below it -
 
EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The lander is PERILOUSLY CLOSE to the RED HOT UNDERSIDE of the SPINNING ENDURANCE. The lander BANKS sideways, bringing its airlock within FEET of the spinning Endurance -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks sideways at the spinning hull -
COOPER
Case, you ready?
CASE
Ready.
Cooper watches the spinning hull, suddenly UNCERTAIN -
CASE
Cooper?
(Off look.)
This is no time for caution.
COOPER
(grins)
If I black out, take the stick - Tars, get ready to engage the docking mechanism - Brand, hold tight -

CASE
Endurance is starting to heat -
COOPER
HIT IT!
Case hits the RETRO-THRUSTERS. The view SPINS -

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The lander goes into a FASTER AND FASTER SPIN as it, with Endurance, PLUMMETS towards the planet -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
LIGHT FLASHES across their faces as the G-force of the spin PULLS THEM AGAINST THEIR RESTRAINTS. Cooper STRUGGLES to
stay conscious - they BUFFET AGAINST THE ATMOSPHERE -
Tars opens the airlock - the Endurance hatch above him is now SLOWLY ROTATING relative to him ...
 
EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The GLOWING HOT Endurance and the lander PLUMMET, SPINNING towards the ice planet, whose curvature is FAST DISAPPEARING
-

INT. AIRLOCK, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Tars peers up as THE SPIN SPEEDS MATCH. He waits as the BUFFETING moves the hatches ... THEY LINE UP - he FIRES the GRAPPLES - they don’t connect - the hatches moved -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Brand loses consciousness - Cooper watches the instruments, not the dizzying view, on the point of RED OUT -
COOPER
Come on, Tars ... come on ...

INT. AIRLOCK, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Tars sees the hatches roll back into ALIGNMENT. He FIRES AGAIN - this time THE GRAPPLES HOLD -
TARS
GOT IT!

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper registers this. Case fires the retro-rockets to slow the spin.

COOPER
Gen-- gentle, Case ...

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The two craft, NOW JOINED, start to spin more SLOWLY ...

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper eases back into his seat as the G-force lessens -
COOPER
Get ready to pull us up -
The spin is slowing to almost nothing -
 

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Parts are RIPPING off the Endurance in the HEAT -

Cooper EASES into POWER on the main thrusters - COOPER
Come on. You can do it ...

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The THRUSTERS on the lander start to DRAG both ships back up away from the planet, the heat DIMINISHING -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper pulls back on the sticks, RELIEF washing over him. Brand comes to ... Cooper turns to Case, grinning -
COOPER
Right? And for our next trick ...
CASE
It’ll have to be good. We’re heading into Gargantua’s pull -
Cooper’s smile fades. He UNBUCKLES -
COOPER
Take her -

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
HISSING STEAM - RUSHING AIR - WHIRLING DEBRIS as Tars and
Cooper (in suit and helmet) lock down different BULKHEADS -
Brand (in suit and helmet) FLOATS alongside the POPULATION BOMB, checking the equipment -
CASE
(over radio)
Cooper, we’re slipping towards Gargantua - shall I use main engines?
 

COOPER
No! Let her slide as long as we can
-
Cooper FLIES over to Tars, who is welding a bulkhead -
COOPER
Give it to me.
TARS
There’s good news and bad news -
COOPER
I’ve heard that one, Tars - just give it to me straight.

INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper SCRAMBLES to where Brand is checking her equipment.
COOPER
The navigation mainframe’s destroyed and we don’t have enough life support to make it back to Earth. But we might scrape to Edmunds’ planet.
BRAND
What about fuel?
COOPER
Not enough. But I’ve got a plan - let Gargantua suck us right to her horizon - then a powered slingshot around to launch us at Edmunds.
BRAND
Manually?
COOPER
That’s what I’m here for. I’ll take us just inside the critical orbit.
BRAND
And the time slippage?
COOPER
Neither of us can afford to worry about relativity right now.
 

BRAND
I’m sorry, Cooper.
They embrace, delicately touching faceplate to faceplate.

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The CRIPPLED Endurance FALLS towards the HEART OF DARKNESS among the stars ...

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - DAY
Cooper looks ahead at Gargantua. Preparing for battle.

EXT. ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
The lander DETACHES, shifting its orientation ...
COOPER
(over radio)
Once we’ve gathered enough speed around Gargantua - we use the lander 1 Ranger 2 as
rocket-boosters to push us out of the black hole’s gravity ...
The lander REATTACHES to the rear of the ring module.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER 2 - CONTINUOUS
Cooper slides into Ranger 2 - checking the systems.
COOPER
The linkages between landers are destroyed ...

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Tars sits at the controls, running similar checks ...
COOPER
(over radio)
So we’ll control manually. When Lander 1’s spent, Tars will detach
...
 

TARS
And get sucked into that black hole.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Case listen to Cooper and Tars over the radio.
BRAND
Why does he have to detach?
COOPER
(over radio)
We have to shed mass if we’re gonna escape that gravity.
TARS
(over radio)
Newton’s third law - the only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind.
BRAND
Cooper, you can’t ask Tars to do this for us -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER 2 - CONTINUOUS
Cooper puts his hands on the controls -
COOPER
He’s a robot, Amelia - I don’t have to ask him to do anything.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand is furious -

BRAND
Cooper, you asshole -
COOPER

Sorry, you broke up a little there.
TARS
(over radio)
It’s what we intended, Dr Brand ...
 

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Tars sits at the controls, ready.
TARS
It’s our last chance to save people on Earth - if I can find some way to transmit the quantum data I’ll find in there, they might still make it.

Not a whiteout - a SHIMMERING CAVALCADE OF ALL WAVELENGTHS: LIGHT, SOUND, EVERYTHING ... the SPHERICAL INSIDE OF THE BLACK HOLE, like a STAR turned INSIDE OUT. COOPER IS

Come on, Murph! We don’t have much time!

EXT. GARGANTUA - DAY
A BLACK DOT appears, RUSHING TOWARDS US to become - A DARK SPHERE - we PLUNGE through it into SILENT DARKNESS - a WHITE SPHERE races towards us -

Just as the wormhole was a spherical hole, THESE SPHERES ARE HOLES WITHIN HOLES ... we are dropping through A
FOUR-DIMENSIONAL RABBIT HOLE - LIGHT/DARK/LIGHT/DARK/LIGHT/DARK with BLINDING RAPIDITY -
the frequency almost SPEAKING. Cooper hangs on for dear life

COMPUTER VOICE (O.S.)
FUEL CELL OVERLOAD. DESTRUCTION IMMINENT. INITIATE EJECTION.

Cooper is LAUNCHED out of Ranger 2, which EXPLODES, and, PULLED to one side, MISSES A WHITE HOLE - PLUNGING INSTEAD TOWARDS A SMALLER GLASS-LIKE SPHERE -

Cooper slows as he falls towards this sphere, reminiscent of the wormhole, but the light within is not stars but an infinity of WORLD LINES - (paths of objects through spacetime) -

Cooper PLUNGES INTO THE WORLD SPHERE ... As he falls his SINGLE WORLD LINE stretches behind him - the INFINITE FUTURES OF HIS WORLD LINE splitting ahead to all the different possibilities in spacetime -

Cooper himself is now like a ring being pulled down a cone of fabric. He STARES at the ORDERED CHAOS of world lines ...

As he SLOWS his past and future world lines BREAK UP so they become like INFINITE REFLECTIONS IN PARALLEL MIRRORS ...
Cooper’s world line DROPS into a SMALL, SQUARE TUNNEL -

INT. THE TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Tight enough to feel BLINDINGLY FAST at first, but Cooper (and his INFINITE OTHERS) is actually SLOWING ... Cooper DESPERATELY reaches out, KNOCKING the sides of the tunnel, TRYING to slow himself - GRAPPLING - KICKING ’BRICKS’ out of
 

the ’walls’. He finally STOPS. Looks around in the SUDDEN CALM, FLOATING, catching his breath. He reaches out to the tunnel wall - CONFUSED -

Each ’brick’ is TIGHTLY PACKED PAPER ... PAGES ... BOOKS - AS SEEN FROM BEHIND A SHELF ...

Cooper PUSHES against a book - it MOVES SLIGHTLY. Cooper PUSHES, HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER -
The book drops out of sight, revealing -
Murph, aged ten, wet hair, towel around her neck, TURNS, STARTLED by THE BOOK FALLING FROM HER SHELF.
COOPER
Murph? Murph?
She can’t hear him ...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Murph (ten) stands there, startled, STARING at the bookshelves. At the book on the floor, a broken toy beside it ...

Murph (ten) stands up holding the broken LUNAR LANDER ...
 

INT. THE TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper watches Murph (ten) examine the two pieces of the LUNAR LANDER MODEL -

COOPER MURPH! MURPH!

She turns ... leaves the room ... Cooper floats there, staring. He LOOKS around - each ’wall’ of the tesseract is a different view of Murph’s bedroom, so that by rotating he can effectively orbit her room ...

He claws his way down to the next book wall. PUNCHES out two books -

Murph’s bedroom, empty. The door opens, Cooper’s EARLIER SELF is standing there, staring at the room, perturbed. Murph (ten) joins Cooper, staring at the empty room ...
Cooper LASHES out at the books - kicks a book out - SPOTS -
Murph (ten) closes her door, crying, sliding the desk in front -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) feels the desk. She puts her hand on the back of the chair, tilts it slightly, remembering -

MURPH
Just go. If you’re leaving - just leave now.
 

INT. THE TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, the frustrated observer, spins around to see his EARLIER SELF nudging the door -
COOPER
(to his earlier self) Don’t go, you idiot!
His Earlier Self shuts the door ...
COOPER
Don’t leave your kids. You goddamn fool.
Cooper PUNCHES OUT books with all his strength -
COOPER S ... T ...
Murph (ten) is watching, no longer scared, fascinated -
COOPER A ... Y ...
Cooper STOPS. Catches his breath. Waits ...
Earlier Cooper lifts the chair off the table to enter. Cooper watches his earlier self, FRUSTRATED -
COOPER
Stay, you idiot! Tell him, Murph! Stay ...

As before, Cooper gives Murph the WATCH ... Murph THROWS THE WATCH and TURNS AWAY ...
COOPER
Murph, tell him again! Don’t let him leave ...!

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) picks up the notebook. Opens it. Finds the word ’STAY’ ... looks up at the books, REALIZING ...
 
INT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper is crying with frustration ...
COOPER
Murph, don’t let me leave ...
Cooper watches as his earlier self heads to the door -
COOPER
STAY!!
Cooper SMASHES a book from the shelf with all his might - His earlier self turns back. Looks at the book. Then leaves. Cooper rests his head against the books, SOBBING.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) lowers her notebook, moves to the bookshelves, IN AWE ...

MURPH
Dad ... it was you. You were my ghost ...
She is crying. Joyful.

INT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper sobs at the back of the books. Lost ...
TARS

Cooper?
Cooper, STARTLED, turns. Tars is not there.
COOPER
You survived.
TARS
(over radio) Somewhere. In their fifth dimension. They saved us ...
COOPER
(frustrated)
Who’s ’They’? And why would they help us?
 

TARS
(over radio)
I don’t know, but they constructed this three-dimensional space inside their five-dimensional reality to allow you to understand it ...
COOPER
It isn’t working -!
TARS
(over radio)
Yes, it is. You’ve seen that time is represented here as a physical dimension - you even worked out that you can exert a force across spacetime -
COOPER
(realizing)
Gravity. To send a message ...
Cooper looks around the infinite tunnel, infinite Coopers.
COOPER
Gravity crosses the dimensions - including time -

Cooper THINKS ... He pulls himself up to a different wall, starts counting books ...
And you have the quantum data, now
-

TARS
(over radio)
I’m transmitting it on all wavelengths - but nothing’s getting out ...

COOPER
I can do it -
Cooper HITS a book’s world line, sending a WAVE ...
TARS
(over radio)
Such complicated data ... to a child ...

COOPER
Not just any child.
 

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) stands there, looking at her old notebook - the page that says ’STAY’ ...

GETTY (O.S.)
MURPH?! COME ON!
She looks around the room, SEARCHING for an answer ...

EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper watches Murph (ten) looking out the window ...
TARS
(over radio)
Even if you communicate it here, she wouldn’t understand its significance for years ...
Cooper is seized by a sudden anger -
COOPER
Then figure something out! Everybody on Earth is going to die!
TARS
Cooper, they didn’t bring us here to change the past.
Cooper hears something in this -
COOPER
We brought ourselves here ...
Cooper PUSHES off, looking through the gaps in the books. Murph’s bedroom, full of DUST in the DUST STORM -
COOPER
Tars, feed me the coordinates of NASA in binary ...
Cooper is in the room now, drawing a pattern in the dust ...
Cooper watches Murph (ten) burst into the room. Murph stops and stares at the dust as Cooper’s Earlier Self comes in past her, SLAMS the window shut - sees the PATTERN of dust
...
 

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) runs her finger along the DUST of the windowsill ... She turns to look around the room.
Frustrated.

MURPH
Come on, Dad. Is there something else here ...?

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks up from the floor -
COOPER
Don’t you see, Tars? I brought myself here. We’re here to communicate with the
three-dimensional world. We’re the bridge ...

Cooper moves to another iteration of Murph’s room. Murph (ten) JUMPS up - GRABS the WATCH, RUNS out the door ...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) looks at the watch, remembering. The second hand TWITCHES. She drops the watch back into the box ...

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper pushes himself along the world line of the books ...
COOPER
I thought they chose me - they never chose me - they chose Murph.
TARS
(over radio)
For what?

COOPER
To save the world!
Murph (ten) comes back into her bedroom, SOBBING. She is holding the watch. She puts it on the shelf.
 

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) puts the box back on the shelf. SIGHS ...

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper races FASTER and FASTER down the world lines.
COOPER
’They’ have access to infinite time, infinite space ...
Cooper gestures at the INFINITIES in all directions ...
COOPER
But no way to find what they need - but I can find Murph and find a way to tell her - like I found this moment -

 


How?
 
TARS
(over radio)

COOPER
 
Love, Tars. Love - just like Brand said - that’s how we find things here.

TARS
(over radio)
So what are we here to do?
Cooper looks around the tesseract. The watch sits there on the shelf for as long as he can see ...
COOPER
The watch. That’s it. She’ll come back for it -
TARS
How do you know?
COOPER
Because I gave it to her. We use the second hand. Translate the data into Morse and feed it to me -

Tars starts to transmit. Cooper GRABS the second-hand world line - starts to MANIPULATE it, sending waves down the world line ...
 

TARS
What if she never came back for it?
COOPER
She will. She will ... I feel it
...
The second hand is FLICKING back and forth ...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) turns to leave ...
GETTY (O.S.)
MURPH, HE’S COMING!
She pauses. Goes back to the box - reaches in. PULLS OUT THE WATCH ... staring at it ... wondering ...

GETTY (O.S.)
MURPH?! MURPH ...?!

EXT. FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT
Getty is holding a tire iron, watching TOM’S TRUCK APPROACH. Lois and Coop STARE, FEARFUL, from the truck ...
Tom APPROACHES, BLACK from soot ...
Murph BURSTS out of the house ... right up to Tom ...
MURPH
Tom, he came back ... he came back
...

 

Who?
 
TOM
 

She holds up the watch ...
MURPH
Dad. It was him. All this time ... it was him. He’s going to save us
...
CLOSE ON the second hand of the watch, FLICKING back and forth -
 

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - DAY
Murph furiously TRANSCRIBES the movements of the second hand
-

INT. CORRIDOR, NASA - LATER
Murph, papers in hand, RUNS down the corridor, BUMPS into Getty - doesn’t stop ...

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
Murph runs to the railing of the catwalk above the enormous construction, looks down at the thousands of workers below. Getty comes out after her, curious. She looks at him, then SHOUTS OUT to the enormous space ...
MURPH
EU-RE-KA!
She turns to Getty - GRINNING.
Well, it’s traditional.
She THROWS her paper out over the railing - EUREKA!!
Workers look up to see her papers flitting down ...

EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper looks out at the world line of the watch, of Murph, as it leads out into infinite complexity ...
COOPER
Did it work?
TARS
(over radio)
I think it might have.
COOPER
(hopeful)
Why?
TARS
(over radio)
Because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract ...
 

Cooper looks out to the distance - it is RAPIDLY APPROACHING, WORLD LINES BECOMING WORLD SHEETS, BECOMING BULKS ...

COOPER
Don’t you get it, yet, Tars? ’They’ aren’t ’beings’ ... they’re us ... trying to help ... just like I tried to help Murph ...
TARS
(over radio)
People didn’t build this tesseract
-

COOPER
Not yet ... but one day. Not you and me but people, people who’ve evolved beyond the four dimensions we know ...

The tesseract EXPANSION BACK INTO FIVE DIMENSIONS IS ALMOST UPON THEM - Cooper BRACES HIMSELF -
COOPER
What happens now -?
BAM - he is swept up in the expansion like a tiny leaf on a CHURNING WAVE -

Cooper FLIES through the EXPANDING COSMOS, past PLANETS ORBITING STARS, WHICH BECOME ATOMIC PARTICLES, WHICH BECOME MATTER, BECOMING STARS ...

Cooper APPROACHES A GLASSY TUBE. Inside is the OLD, UNDAMAGED ENDURANCE. As Cooper looks in from the bulk he sees: Brand, strapped in, Doyle opposite, traversing the wormhole for the first time ...
Cooper REACHES for Brand ... She sees something, reaches up
- their hands would touch if they weren’t in different dimensions, her fingers distorting the space of his fingers
-
WHAM! She, and the Endurance, are SWEPT PAST - Cooper is SMASHED into the spacetime of the wormhole - he SCREAMS AND WE -
 
INT. OUTER SPACE - LATER
Cooper FLOATS, dead or unconscious, near Saturn. In the distance we see two Rangers approaching ...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Cooper’s eyes flicker open. A bright room with an open window, net curtains obscuring the view. We hear the CRACK of a baseball off a bat. Children LAUGHING.

VOICE (O.S.)
Mr Cooper? Mr Cooper?
Cooper looks over to see a Nurse and a Doctor watching him. He tries to sit up.

DOCTOR
Take it slow, sir. Remember you’re no spring chicken any more.
(Amused.)
I gather you’re one hundred and twenty-four years old.
(Checks Cooper’s chart.) You were extremely lucky. The
Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply -
COOPER
Where am I?
The Doctor, almost surprised, TURNS, moves to the window, opens the curtains. Where Cooper should see sky, he sees a CURVING UPSIDE-DOWN TOWN ...
DOCTOR
Cooper Station. Currently orbiting Saturn.

The Nurse helps Cooper to the window. He looks out at the VAST CYLINDRICAL STATION - cornfields and buildings. Outside his window, kids are playing baseball. The batter hits a POP FLY ... the kids watch it up and up, until it carries on, falling up towards the buildings above. The kids SHOUT a warning - the ball smashes a skylight. Cooper watches the kids laugh.

COOPER
Nice of you to name the place after me.
The Nurse giggles. The Doctor shoots her a look -
 

What?
DOCTOR
The station wasn’t named after you, sir ... It was named after your daughter.
Cooper smiles at this ...
DOCTOR
Although, she’s always maintained just how important you were -
COOPER
Is she ...
(Braces.) still alive?
DOCTOR
She’ll be here in a couple weeks. She’s really far too old for a transfer from another station, but when she heard you’d been found ... well, this is Murphy Cooper we’re talking about.
COOPER
(marveling) Yes, it is ...
The Doctor is wrapping up -
DOCTOR
We’ll have you checked out in a couple days.
Cooper turns back to the window, thinking ...
ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
I’m sure you’ll be excited to see what’s in store ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - DAY
The ADMINISTRATOR, thirties, leads Cooper along a walkway -
ADMINISTRATOR
We’ve got a nice situation for you
...
 

Cooper looks down at a line of SLEEK NEXT-GENERATION RANGERS. Sees a PILOT climb into one. Mechanics work another
...

ADMINISTRATOR
I actually did a paper on you in high school, sir. I know all about your life on Earth ...

EXT. TOWN SQUARE, COOPER STATION - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks at the strangely ordinary town the Administrator is walking him through ...
ADMINISTRATOR
So when I made my suggestion to Ms Cooper, I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect ...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The Adminstrator leads Cooper through a cornfield ... The old farmhouse is there, preserved. As Cooper approaches, a small monitor starts playing the footage of OLD-TIMERS from the start of the movie.
ADMINISTRATOR
Of course, I didn’t speak to her personally ...

As Cooper passes the monitor it changes to a FAMILIAR OLD LADY, but Cooper misses it ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
OLD-TIMERS play on video screens: a museum exhibit. The Administrator holds the door open for Cooper.
ADMINISTRATOR
But she confirmed just how much you loved farming.
COOPER
She did, huh?
Cooper looks over the kitchen. Cooper sees a familiar-looking articulated machine -
 

COOPER
Is that ...?
ADMINISTRATOR
The machine we found out near Saturn when we found you, yes. Its power source was shot, but we could get you another if you want to try and get it up and running again.
Cooper turns to the Administrator.
COOPER
Please.

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - EVENING
Cooper, from the catwalk, watches the last of the Rangers come back from patrol. The PILOT jumps down as the ground crew wheels it into its place in the line of sleek ships.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Cooper has Tars’ head laid out on the kitchen table.
TARS
Settings: general settings, security setting -
COOPER
Honesty. New level setting. Ninety-five percent.
TARS
Confirmed. Additional customization?
COOPER
Yes. Humor, seventy-five percent. Wait.
(Thinks.) Sixty percent.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters, nervous. A nurse is there.
COOPER
Is she -?
 

NURSE
The family’s all in there.
COOPER
The family?
NURSE
They all came along to see her - she’s been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper cautiously pushes open the door. The bed is surrounded by people, grown-up children, grandchildren, babies ... They turn to look at him: some SMILES, some CURIOUS looks, a small child HIDES behind a parent’s leg ...

Cooper approaches, and the family parts to let him see an ELDERLY WOMAN, lying in the bed, FRAIL.

She looks up at Cooper. Delighted. Tears of joy. She reaches up to him ... he takes her hands.
COOPER
 
Murph.

Dad.
 

MURPH
 
(To the others.) Please.

Her voice is a frail whisper. With authority. The family shuffles out. Cooper watches them go, turns back to Murph.
COOPER
You told them I like farming.
Murph smiles, still mischievous. Cooper marvels at her.
COOPER
Murph, it was me. I was your ghost.
MURPH
I know ...
She lifts her wrist - the WATCH is there ...
MURPH
People didn’t believe me, they thought I’d done it all myself ...
(Taps watch.)
(MORE)
 

MURPH (cont’d) But I knew who it was ...
COOPER
A father looks in his child’s eyes and thinks - maybe it’s them - maybe my child will save the world.
MURPH
And everyone, once a child, wants to looks into their own dad’s eyes and know he saw. But, usually, by then, the father is gone. Nobody believed me, but I knew you’d come back.

 

How?
 
COOPER

MURPH
 
Because my dad promised me.
Cooper is crying now.
COOPER
I’m here now. I’m here for you, Murph.
Murph is shaking her head.
MURPH
No parent should have to watch their child die. My kids are here for me now. Go.
COOPER
Where?
MURPH
(it’s so obvious) Brand.

And the family comes back in as Cooper releases Murph’s hand, stepping back to let Murph’s kids and grandkids swarm over her ... He watches them, their love, as if from another dimension. A man out of time. A ghost.

MURPH (V.O.)
She’s out there ...
 

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand, in suit and helmet, stands watching Case excavate a pod, buried under a massive rock fall. She is crying.

MURPH (V.O.)
Setting up camp ...

EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
MECHANIC finishes looking over one of the sleek new Rangers. He packs his tools and heads out.

A figure unfolds itself in the shadows - Tars. He picks his way through the shadows, unlocks the door. Cooper DARTS in
...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand kneels in front of a small CROSS. Edmunds’ nameplate hangs from it.

MURPH
... Alone in a strange galaxy ...
She unseals her helmet - PULLS IT OFF ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
Cooper and Tars scurry down the line of sleek ships. Cooper points - Tars starts working the hatch mechanism, while Cooper KEEPS WATCH ...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand, helmet off, BREATHES. And breathes again.
MURPH (V.O.)
Maybe, right now, she’s settling in for the long nap ...
 

INT. RANGER IN HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
Cooper STRAPS into the pilot’s chair, Tars beside him. The outer doors slide open. They look out at the inky blackness of space ...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK
Brand looks at the setting sun ...
MURPH (V.O.)
By the light of our new sun ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - MORNING
The Mechanic opening up, walks along the row of ships until
-
One is MISSING.

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK
Brand turns from the dwindling light ...
MURPH (V.O.)
In our new home.
She heads down through the twilight towards camp. And we - Fade out.
Credits.

SHOOTING SCRIPT
 
FADE IN:
DAWN. CRASHING SURF.
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

A CHILD’S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He COLLAPSES.

The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER

The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

ATTENDANT
(in Japanese)
He was delirious. But he asked for you by name. And...
(to the Security Guard) Show him.

SECURITY GUARD
(in Japanese)
He was carrying nothing but this...
He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.
SECURITY GUARD
...and this.

The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
(in Japanese)
Bring him here. And some food.
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food. He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
(in English)
Are you here to kill me?
The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
 

The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and forefinger.

ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
I know what this is.

He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
I’ve seen one before. Many, many years ago...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream...

MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
A man possessed of some radical notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...
COBB (V.O.)
What’s the most resilient parasite?
CUT TO: INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)
The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.

COBB
A bacteria? A virus?
Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-
COBB
An intestinal worm?

Saito’s fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-

ARTHUR
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

COBB
An idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
 

COBB
Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea’s taken hold in the brain it’s almost impossible to eradicate. A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there.

SAITO
But surely-to forget...?
COBB
Information, yes. But an idea? Fully formed, understood? That sticks...
(taps forehead) In there, somewhere.

SAITO
For someone like you to steal?
ARTHUR
Yes. In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. It’s called extraction.

COBB
But, Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor.

SAITO
How can you do that?
COBB
Because I am the most skilled extractor. I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks, and I can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you’re asleep, your guard is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito’s gaze.
COBB
But if I’m going to help you, you have to be completely open to me. I’ll need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone.
(gestures around)
If this is a dream and you’ve got a safe full of secrets, I need to know what’s in that safe. For this to work, you have to let me in.
 

Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.

SAITO
Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-

ARTHUR
He knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS FROZEN.

ARTHUR
What’s going on up there?
And we-
CUT TO:
FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)
Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.

Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
 

A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.

Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME. Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY WHUMP− Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other GUESTS wander the massive terraces.

ARTHUR
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
COBB
I can get it here. The information's in the safe− he looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.
ARTHUR
What's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.

COBB
You just get to your room. I'll take care of the rest.

ARTHUR
See that you do. We're here to work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb. Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-

MAL
If I jumped, would I survive?
 

COBB
With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.
MAL
I thought you might be missing me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.
COBB
I am. But I can't trust you anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.

MAL
So what?

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis Bacon.

MAL
Looks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS patrolling the castle at ground level.

COBB
Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.
COBB
Would you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair. Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.

MAL
Tell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.
MAL
Do the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's ankle. He looks up at her.
 

COBB
You can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting out the rope as he moves back to the window.

MAL
What're you doing?
Cobb tosses the rope out-
COBB
Getting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with Mal on it, holds.

COBB
Stay seated. Please.
And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window. EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS
Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-
INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the window-

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.

INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS

Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows... Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
 

PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.
SAITO (O.S.)
Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.

MAL
The gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.

MAL
Please.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY down the length or the table.

SAITO
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands raised.

COBB
Did she tell you, or have you known all along?

SAITO
That you're here to steal from me? (beat)
Or that we're actually asleep?
Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.
SAITO
I want to know who your employer is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
 

COBB
No point threatening him in a dream.

MAL
That depends on what you're threatening. Killing him would just wake him up... but pain? Pain is in the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.

MAL
And, judging by the decor, we're in
your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE− Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at the ceiling, DEAD, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY
Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-
NASH
What're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.

ARTHUR
I know! We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the bedroom− following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist- SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-

CUT TO:
INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the building BUCKS and HEAVES-
 

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.

MAL
He was close. Very close.
EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE- INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-

SAITO
Stop him!

Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK. Mal smiles, amused.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS from his envelope, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES, SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-

ARTHUR
I'm not going to make it! Wake Cobb!

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the face, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...
 

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-

CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN. AWAKE. INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nash SMACKS Cobb again-
NASH
He won't wake!
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-CONTINUOUS
Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.

ARTHUR
Dunk him!

A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM BACKWARDS− as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we are in SLOW MOTION, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the last sheet of paper. He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-

CUT TO:
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb in SLOW MOTION, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he goes under- and we-

CUT TO:
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH ALL THE WINDOWS, FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-
 

COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...

HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THE- INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY
Cobb’s AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.

Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS, Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is over.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds of RIOTING grow louder.

COBB
You came prepared.
SAITO
I bring the gun because not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?

Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.
COBB
Hard for a man in your position to keep a love nest totally secret... particularly when there's a married woman involved.

SAITO
She would never...
COBB
And yet, here we are.
Saito is silent.
COBB
With a dilemma.
SAITO
You got what you came for.
COBB
Not quite. The key piece of information wasn't there, was it, Mr. Saito?
 

Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried.
ARTHUR
They're getting closer, Cobb.

CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then pulls out an MP3 player and we-

CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Saito's eyes are on the floor.
COBB
You held something back because you knew what we were up to...

Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.
COBB
So why let us in at all?
Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...
SAITO
An audition.
COBB
Audition for what?
SAITO
It doesn't matter. You failed.
COBB
I extracted all the information you had in there.

SAITO
But your deception was readily apparent.

And we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERS DISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.
 

Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he RAISES the volume...

Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-

CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...

SAITO
So leave me and go.
COBB
You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure. We won't last two days...

The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.

ARTHUR
Come on, Cobb.
COBB
So now I have to do this the old- fashioned way-

Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-
When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING. SAITO
I've always hated this carpet.
Cobb’s eyes flick to the carpet and back.
SAITO
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways...

Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.
SAITO
But very definitely made of wool. Right now I'm lying on polyester.
 

Cobb glares at Nash, and we-

CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY
Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.
SAITO
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment...
(smiles)
You've lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming.

Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes.
TODASHI
How'd it go?

ARTHUR
Not good.

Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.
SAITO
A dream within a dream-I'm impressed.

Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-

CUT TO:
 

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the next countdown hit ZERO, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches Cobb. Nash is behind Saito.

SAITO
But in my dream, we really ought to be playing by my rules...

NASH
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-
Saito turns to Nash-
COBB
We're not in your dream-
Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED-
NASH
We're in mine.

Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS
GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-

CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Nash’ eyes open, AWAKE.

ARTHUR (O.S.)
Asshole!

Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.
ARTHUR
How could you get the carpet wrong?!

NASH
It wasn't my fault!
ARTHUR
You're the architect-
 

NASH
I didn't know he was going to rub his damn cheek on it!

Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.

COBB
Lets go.

ARTHUR
And you-what the hell was all that?
COBB
I had it under control.
ARTHUR
I’d hate to see out of control-
COBB
There's no time for this-I'm getting off at Kyoto.

ARTHUR
Why? He's not gonna search every compartment.

COBB
I can't stand trains.
Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.
ARTHUR
I can keep him under for one minute-

Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-

COBB
Every man for himself.

Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.

EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS
The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape. INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Saito WAKES GENTLY. Looks around the compartment, empty but for Todashi, reading a comic. Saito looks down at his wrist. Sees a small mark. Rubs it. SMILES.
 

EXT. TOKYO - DUSK

Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.

INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO - CONTINUOUS

Cobb sits, waiting. Checks his watch, restless. He pulls a HANDGUN. Checks it is loaded. places it on the table in front of him. Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the table ... He INTENT STUDIES the top's spin... As he stares, the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the top WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS. the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-

CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad.
COBB
Hey, guys. How are you?
CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
Good. Okay, I guess.

Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT CUT: COBB's MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards us,
crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...
COBB
Who's just okay? Was that James?
JAMES (over phone)
Yeah. When are you coming home?
COBB
I can't. Not for a while.

INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...

JAMES (over phone)
Why?

COBB
Well, James, like I've told you-I'm away because I'm working...

LITTLE GIRL (over phone) Grandma says you're never coming back.

Cobb pauses. Takes a breath. INSERT CUT: James and Philippa, FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to someone's call− they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...
 

COBB
Philippa, can you ask Grandma to pick up the phone-

PHILIPPA (over phone)
She's shaking her head.
Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.
COBB
Well, we'll just have to hope Grandma's wrong about that won't we?

JAMES
(over phone)
Daddy?

COBB
Yes?

JAMES (over phone)
Is Mommy with you?

Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S MEMORY− MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...

COBB
No. No, we talked about this, James. Mommy's gone.

JAMES (over phone)
Where?

GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)
Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-
COBB
I'll give some presents to Grandpa, okay? Just be good for-

Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK at the door. Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the door- cracks it: Arthur.

ARTHUR
Our ride's on the roof.
Cobb nods. Moves to pick up his bag. Arthur watches.
ARTHUR
Cobb... are you okay?
Cobb looks up.
 

COBB
Yeah, why?

ARTHUR
Down in the dream... Mal showing up like that ...

COBB
Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.
ARTHUR
It's getting worse, isn't it?
COBB
One apology's all you're getting, Arthur. Now, where's Nash?

ARTHUR
Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?
COBB
(shakes head)
We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago. By now they know we failed. Time to disappear.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.
ARTHUR
Where will you go?
COBB
Buenos Aires. I can lie low there. Maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?

ARTHUR
Stateside.

COBB
(wistful) )
'Course. Send my regards.
Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic. EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT
The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the leather-padded interior. He freezes.
 

INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.

SAITO
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life...

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.
SAITO
So I offer you the satisfaction.
COBB
That's not how I deal with things.
SAITO
Would you work with him again?

Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.

COBB
What will you do to him?
SAITO
Nothing. But I can't speak for your friends from Cobol Engineering.

Saito looks out at the city slipping by.
COBB
What do you want from us?

SAITO
Inception.

Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.
SAITO
Is it possible?
ARTHUR
Of course not.
SAITO
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead?

ARTHUR
Okay, here's planting an idea: I say to you, "Don't think about elephants."
(MORE)
 
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
(Saito nods)
What are you thinking about?

SAITO
Elephants.

ARTHUR
Right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you.

SAITO
You could plant it subconsciously-
ARTHUR
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.

COBB
No, it isn't.
SAITO
Can you do it?
COBB
I won't do it.
SAITO
In exchange, I'll give you the information you were paid to steal.

COBB
Are you giving me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.

SAITO
Then you do have a choice.
COBB
And I choose to leave.
EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER
The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET. INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
Saito indicates the plane.
SAITO
Tell the crew where you want to go, they'll file the plan en route.

Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door.
 

SAITO
Mr. Cobb...? There is one other thing I could offer you.
(Cobb stops)
How would you like to go home? To America. To your children.

Cobb turns back to Saito.
COBB
You can't fix that. Nobody could.
SAITO
Just like inception.
Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.
ARTHUR
Cobb, come on-
COBB
How complex is the idea?
SAITO
Simple enough.
COBB
No idea's simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind.

SAITO
My main competitor is an old man in poor health. His son will soon inherit control of the corporation. I need him to decide to break up his father's empire. Against his own self-interest.

ARTHUR
Cobb, we should walk away from this.

COBB
If I were to do it. If I could do it... how do I know you can deliver?

SAITO
You don't. But I can. So do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?

Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.
 

SAITO
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely.

INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER
Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry.
ARTHUR
I know how much you want to go home-
COBB
(sharp) No, you don't.

ARTHUR
But this can't be done.
COBB
It can. You just have to go deep enough.

ARTHUR
You don't know that!-
COBB
I've done it before.
Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.
ARTHUR
Did it work?

COBB
(quiet)
Yes.

ARTHUR
Who did you do it to?
Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.
ARTHUR
So why are we headed to Paris?
COBB
We're going to need a new architect.

INT. GREAT HALL, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MORNING

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.
 

INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS
COBB (O.S.)
You never did like your office.
PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cobb.
MILES
No space to think in that broom cupboard.

Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.
MILES
Is it safe for you to be here?
COBB
Extradition between France and the
U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.
MILES
I think they'd find a way to make it work in your case.

Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.
COBB
Can you take these back for the kids?

MILES
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father.

COBB
I know. I thought you could talk to Marie about bringing them on vacation. Somewhere I could meet-

MILES
Why would she listen to me?
COBB
You were married for twenty years.
MILES
She blames me as much as you.
COBB
Doesn't she understand that my kids need me?
 

MILES
Yes, she does. We all do. Go back and face the music, Dom. Explain what Mal did.

COBB
Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never understand− they'd lock me up and throwaway the key. Or worse.

MILES
You think what you're doing now is helping your case?

COBB
Lawyers don't pay for themselves. This is what I have. This is what you taught me.

MILES
I never taught you to be a thief.
COBB
No, you taught me to navigate other people's minds. But after what happened with Mal there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.

Miles looks at Cobb.
MILES
Why did you come here, Dom?
Cobb shifts slightly.
COBB
I found a way home. A job. For powerful people. If I pull it off, I can get back to my family. But I need help.

Miles realizes something.
MILES
My God. You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

COBB
If you have someone good enough, you have to let them decide for themselves. You know what I'm offering-

MILES
Money?
 

COBB
No, not just money: the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities- things that have never existed, things that couldn't exist in the real world...

MILES
Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects are supposed to make those dreams real.

COBB
That's not what you used to say. You told me that in the real world I'd be building attic conversions and gas stations. You said that if I mastered the dream-share I'd have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations. You told me it would free me.

Miles looks at Cobb, sad.
MILES
And I'm sorry. I was wrong.
COBB
No, you weren't. Your vision was a vision of pure creativity. It's where we took it that was wrong.

MILES
And now you want me to let someone else follow you into fantasy.

COBB
They won't actually come on the job, they'll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers.

MILES
Design them yourself.
COBB
Mal won't let me.
Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled.
MILES
Come back to reality, Dom. Please.
COBB
You want to know what's real, Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back.
(MORE)
 
COBB (CONT'D)
This job-this last job-is how I get there.

Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.
COBB
I wouldn't be standing here if there were any other way. I can get home. But I need an architect who's as good as I was.

Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides.
MILES
I've got someone better.
INT. CORRIDOR - LATER
Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.

MILES
Ariadne...

A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.
MILES
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.
ARIADNE
Pleased to meet you.
MILES
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer to discuss with you.

ARIADNE
A work placement?
COBB
(smiles Not exactly.

EXT. ROOFTOP, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.

COBB
A test.
 

ARIADNE
(mouth full)
Aren't you going to tell me anything?

COBB
Before I describe the job, I have to know you could do it.

ARIADNE
Why?

COBB
It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
Ariadne raises her eyebrows.
COBB
You have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve.

Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.

COBB
Go.

She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.

COBB
Stop.

Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad, then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.

COBB
Again.

She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...

COBB
Stop.

She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.

COBB
You'll have to-

She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back. Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.

Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen, starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.
 

COBB
(working the maze) More like it.

EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY
Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper. INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open. Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.

INT. SAME - LATER

Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY
Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.
COBB
They say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains... but they're talking about when we're awake. While we dream, the mind performs wonders.

ARIADNE
Such as?

COBB
How do you imagine a building? You consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages... But sometimes, when your imagination flies-

ARIADNE
I'm discovering it.
COBB
Exactly. Genuine inspiration.
Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.
COBB
In a dream your mind continuously
does that...
Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
 

COBB
It creates and perceives a world simultaneously. So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. That's why we can short- circuit the process...

ARIADNE
How?

COBB
By taking over the creating part.
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.
COBB
This is where you come in. You build the world of the dream. We take the subject into that dream, and let him £111 it with his subconscious

ARIADNE
But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life?

COBB
(nods)
While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming.

ARIADNE
How could I ever get enough detail to Convince him that it's real?

COBB
Our dreams reel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange,

Ariadne gestures around them-
ARIADNE
But all the textures of real life- the stone, the fabric. cars... people... your mind can't create all this.

COBB
It does. Every time you dream. Let me ask you a question: You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on.
 

ARIADNE
I guess.

COBB
So... how did we end up at this restaurant?

ARIADNE
We came here from...
Ariadne trails off, confused.
COBB
How did we get here? Where are we?
Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.
ARIADNE
Oh my God. We're dreaming.
Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.
COBB
Stay calm. We're actually asleep in the workshop. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember?

Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-

The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his head against the debris. She sees him-

ARIADNE
(shouting over noise)
If it's just a dream, why are you covering your-

Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Ariadne JOLTS awake.
COBB (O.S.)
Because it's never just a dream.

Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.
 

COBB
And a face full of glass hurts like hell, doesn't it? While we're in it, it's real.

ARTHUR
That's why the military developed dream sharing-a training program where soldiers could strangle, stab and shoot each other, then wake up.

ARIADNE
How did architects get involved?
COBB
Someone had to design the dreams. (to Arthur)
Let's go another five minutes-
ARIADNE
We were only asleep for five minutes? We talked for an hour at least...

COBB
When you dream, your mind functions more quickly, so time seems to pass more slowly.

ARTHUR
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.

COBB
Let's see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes.

And we-

CUT TO:

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY

Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks around at the street, the cafe, approving.

COBB
It's good. You've got the cafe, the layout... you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here.

Ariadne looks at the passers-by.
ARIADNE
Who are the people?
 

COBB
They’re projections of my subconscious.

ARIADNE
Yours?

COBB
Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the subject. My subconscious populates your world. That's one way we get at a subject's thoughts-his mind creates the people, so we can literally talk to his subconscious.

ARIADNE
How else do you do it?
COBB
Architecture. Build a bank vault or a jail, something secure, and the subject's mind will fill it with information he's trying to protect.

ARIADNE
Then you break in and steal it.

COBB
Exactly.

Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.
ARIADNE
I love the concrete sense of things- (stamps foot)
Real weight, you know? I thought a dream space would be all about the visual, but it's the feel of things. Question is, what happens as you start to mess with physics...

She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN HALF− the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her excitement.

ARIADNE
It's something, isn't it?
COBB
(quiet) Yes. It is.
 

As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the projections STARING at her.

ARIADNE
Why are they looking at me?
COBB
Because you're changing things. My subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections converge on you.

ARIADNE
Converge?

COBB
They feel the foreign nature of the dreamer, and attack-like white blood cells fighting an infection.

ARIADNE
They're going to attack us?
COBB
Just you, actually.

They walk along the street to where it joins the next gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty. They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.

COBB
It's beautiful... but if you keep on changing things...

People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them BUMP her shoulder as they pass.

ARIADNE
Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?

COBB
That’s why it’s called subconscious. I don’t control it.

The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.
COBB
Arched stone, iron pillars... it's...
 

Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling, laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.

COBB
I know this bridge. This place is real−
(serious)
You didn't imagine it, you
remembered it...

ARIADNE
(nods)
I cross it every day on my way to the college.

COBB
Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.

ARIADNE
You have to draw from what you know-
COBB
(tense)
Use pieces-a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick-not whole areas.

Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...

ARIADNE
Why not?

COBB
Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.

ARIADNE
Did that happen to you?

Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne. PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.

COBB
Look, this isn't about me-
Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him- ARIADNE
Is that why you need me to build your dreams?
 

A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-
COBB
Leave her alone-

More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away- Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.

ARIADNE
Wake me up, Cobb.
As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-

COBB
Mal, no!

ARIADNE
Wake me up!
Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP-DAY
Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her-

ARTHUR
It's okay.

ARIADNE
Why couldn’t I wake?
ARTHUR
The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die.

Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.
COBB
She'll need a totem.

ARIADNE
What?

ARTHUR
Some kind of personal icon. A small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows,

Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He heads to the bathroom.
 

ARIADNE
That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb.
(calls after him) She's a real charmer!

ARTHUR
Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.
ARIADNE
(surprised) She's his wife?

Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.
ARTHUR
So. A totem. You need something small, potentially heavy...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the marble counter...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.
ARIADNE
Like a coin?
ARTHUR
Too common. You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know.

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more and more ECCENTRIC...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
ARIADNE
What’s yours?
Arthur holds out a DIE.
ARTHUR
A loaded die.
Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away-
 

ARTHUR
I can’t let you handle it. That’s the point. No one else can know the weight or balance of it.

ARIADNE
Why?

ARTHUR
So when you examine your totem...
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Cobb’s spinning top WOBBLES OVER.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
You know, beyond a doubt, that you’re not in someone else’s dream.

Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline. INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne thinks this over.
ARIADNE
That’s not an issue for me.

ARTHUR
Why not?

ARIADNE
Arthur, maybe you can’t see what’s going on, maybe you don’t want to. But Cobb’s got problems he’s tried to bury down there. I’m not going to open my mind to someone like that.

Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.
COBB (O.S.)
She’ll be back.
Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.
COBB
I’ve never seen anyone pick it up so fast. And one reality won’t be enough for her now. When she comes back, get her building mazes.

ARTHUR
Where will you be?
 

COBB
I’ve got to talk to Eames.
ARTHUR
Eames? But he’s in Mombasa. Cobol’s backyard.

COBB
Necessary risk.
ARTHUR
There are plenty of other thieves.
COBB
We don’t just need a thief. We need a forger.

INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40’s), shabby suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He FIDDLES with his last two chips.

COBB (O.S.)
Rub them against each other all you like, they’re not going to breed.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.
EAMES
You never know.
Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...

COBB
Drink?
Eames loses.

EAMES
You’re buying.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

COBB
You’re spelling hasn’t improved.
Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.

EAMES
Piss off.

COBB
How’s your handwriting?
 

Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.

EAMES
Versatile.

INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS
Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.
EAMES
Word is, you’re not welcome in these parts.

COBB
Yeah?

EAMES
There’s a price on your head from Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one, actually.

COBB
You wouldn’t sell me out.
Eames looks at Cobb, offended.
EAMES
‘Course I would.
COBB
(smiles)
Not when you hear what I’m selling.
EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.

COBB
Inception.

Eames’s glass stops halfway to his mouth.
COBB
Don’t bother telling me it’s impossible.

EAMES
It’s perfectly possible. Just bloody difficult.

COBB
That’s what I keep saying to Arthur.
 

EAMES
Arthur? You’re still working with that stick-in-the-mud?

COBB
He’s a good point man.
EAMES
The best. But he has no imagination. If you’re going to perform inception, you need imagination.

COBB
You’ve done it before?
EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the idea in place, but it didn’t take.

COBB
You didn’t plant it deep enough?
EAMES
It’s not just about depth. You need the simplest version of the idea- the one that will grow naturally in the subject’s mind. Subtle art.

COBB
That’s why I’m here.
EAMES
What’s the idea you need to plant?
COBB
We want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father’s empire.

EAMES
See, right there you’ve got various political motivations, anti- monopolistic sentiment and so forth. But all that stuff’s at the mercy of the subject’s prejudice- you have to go to the basic.

COBB
Which is?

EAMES
The relationship with the father. (downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
 

Cobb shakes his head.
EAMES
There’s a man here. Yusuf. He formulates his own versions of the compounds.

COBB
Let’s go see him.
EAMES
Once you’ve lost your tail. (Cobb reacts)
Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in about two minutes after we did.

COBB
Cobol Engineering?
EAMES
They pretty much own Mombasa.
Cobb glances over the balcony.
COBB
Run interference. We’ll meet downstairs in half an hour.

EAMES
Back here?

COBB
Last place they’d expect.
Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.

EAMES
Freddy!

The Businessman looks up, awkward.
EAMES
Freddy Simmonds, it is you!

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into the midst of the crowd on the street below.

EAMES
(looks harder) Oh. No, it isn’t.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is there.
 

COBB
(disarming smile)
Yes?

SECOND BUSINESSMAN
We need to-
Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake, DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables... the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS DRAWN-

Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end- he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.

Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP, BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

SAITO
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
COBB
(jumping in)
What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. Saito?

SAITO
I have to protect my investment.
EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

EAMES
This is your idea of losing a tail?
 

COBB
(shrugs) Different tail.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.

ARTHUR
He said you'd be back.
ARIADNE
I tried not to come.
ARTHUR
But there's nothing else quite like it.

ARIADNE
No paper, no pens... nothing between you and raw, direct creation.

Arthur picks up his mechanism.
ARTHUR
Shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture?

Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-
CUT TO:
INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.

ARTHUR
You're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels.

A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...
ARIADNE
What sort of tricks?
They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.
ARTHUR
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
(MORE)
 
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps. The infinite staircase.

Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.
Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

ARTHUR
See...

Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.

ARTHUR
Paradox. A closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created.

ARIADNE
How big do the levels have to be?
ARTHUR
Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city. But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections.

ARIADNE
A maze.

ARTHUR
And the better the maze-
ARIADNE
The longer we have before the projections catch us.

Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.
ARIADNE
My subconscious seems polite enough.

ARTHUR
You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind.

ARIADNE
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
 

ARTHUR
I don't know if he can't, but he won't. He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.

ARIADNE
Why?

ARTHUR
He won't tell me. I think it's Mal. I think she's getting stronger.

ARIADNE
His ex-wife?
ARTHUR
She's not his ex.
ARIADNE
They're still together?
Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle.
ARTHUR
No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What you see in there is just his projection of her.

ARIADNE
What was she like in real life?
ARTHUR
(quiet) She was lovely.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY

Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.

SAITO
Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate. He's spent his whole life being groomed as successor-breaking up his father's empire will take a radical shift in his thinking.

COBB
What's your problem with Fischer?
SAITO
That's not your concern.
 

COBB
This isn't the usual corporate espionage, Mr. Saito. This is inception. The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man's mind. It'll change him. It might even come to define him.

Saito looks at Cobb.
SAITO
My sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious.

COBB
Then you need new sources, Mr. Saito.

Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.
SAITO
Fischer Morrow has the regulators in their pockets. We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete. Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world. They'll be able to blackmail governments, dictate policy. In effect, they become a new superpower. The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.

EAMES
That's where we come in. How's Robert Fischer's relationship to his father?

SAITO
Rumor is the relationship is complicated.

COBB
We'll need more than rumor, Mr. Saito.

Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).
EAMES
Can you get me access to him? Browning. Fischer senior's right- hand man. Fischer junior's godfather.
 

SAITO
It should be possible. If you can get the right references.

EAMES
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER
Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway. INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty, wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-


INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning. This is YUSUF.

YUSUF
Come, come.
Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.
YUSUF
Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so very much about you.
(indicates chairs) please.

Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.
YUSUF
Bloody cats.

Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass bottles. None of them has a label.

YUSUF
You work using Somnacin, I think, Mr. Cobb?

COBB
You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.
Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.
 

COBB
(dubious) Somnacin?

YUSUF
(proudly) Yusuf's Somnacin.

Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.
COBB
As good as the real thing?
Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.

YUSUF
Better.

Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.
YUSUF
Binds the dreamers tight. Let's them dream as one. Makes it real. Of course, if you'd prefer, you could use Somnacin brand. If you could explain to the international control council what you wanted it for.

Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.
YUSUF
You are seeking a chemist? (Cobb nods)
To formulate compounds for a job?
COBB
And to come into the held with us.
YUSUF
I rarely go into the held, Mr. Cobb.

COBB
We need you there to tailor compounds to our particular requirements.

YUSUF
Which are?

COBB
Great depth.
YUSUF
A dream within a dream? Two levels?
 

COBB
Three.

YUSUF
Not possible. That many dreams within dreams would be too unstable.

COBB
I've done it before. You just have to add a sedative.

YUSUF
A powerful sedative. How many team members?

COBB
Five.

 

Six.
 
SAITO
(to Cobb)
 
The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.

COBB
There's no room for tourists on these jobs, Mr. Saito.

SAITO
This time, it would seem there is.
Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.
YUSUF
Of course. I use it every day.

Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid inside.

COBB
For what?

Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.

YUSUF
Perhaps... you will not want to see.

Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.
 

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN watches over them.

EAMES
(counting)
Eighteen, twenty-all connected, bloody hell.

YUSUF
They come every day. To share the dream.

Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP. The sleeper does not even stir.

YUSUF
See? Very stable.
COBB
How long do they dream?
YUSUF
Three, four hours. Every day.
COBB
How long in dream time?
YUSUF
With this compound... about forty hours. Each and every day.

Saito surveys the room, appalled.
SAITO
Why do they do it?
YUSUF
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
COBB
After a while... (looks at Saito)
It becomes the only way you can dream.

YUSUF
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.
EAMES
They come here every day to sleep?
 

ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)
No.

Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his dreamers.

ELDERLY BALD MAN
They come to be woken up... the dream has become their reality...

The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.
ELDERLY BALD MAN
And who are you to say otherwise?

Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.

COBB
Let's see what you can do.
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him. As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-

CUT TO:
EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY
Cobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him.

YUSUF
Sharp, no?

Cobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around- INT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS
Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT: A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.
 

SAITO
Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?
Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top.
COBB
Everything's fine.
INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over. Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there, unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.

ARIADNE
You're back.
Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out.
ARIADNE
Are you going under on your own?
COBB
I just-I need to test some things. I didn't realize anyone was here.

ARIADNE
Just working on my totem.
Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it.
COBB
Let me see-
Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods.
COBB
You're learning.
ARIADNE
It's an elegant solution to keeping track of reality. Your invention?

COBB
No. Mal's.

Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it.
 

COBB
This one was hers. She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple. Just spin and spin...

ARIADNE
Arthur told me she died.
COBB
She did. How are the mazes coming?
Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.
ARIADNE
Good. Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious we're trying to access. I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so that Fischer will bring his father there-

COBB
Don't tell me. Remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout.

ARIADNE
Why's that so important?
COBB
In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious. You wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout.

ARIADNE
In case you bring Mal in.
Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE
You won't build yourself because if you know the maze, then she knows it. And she'd sabotage the operation. You can't keep her out, can you?

Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE
Do the others know?

COBB
No.
 

ARIADNE
You have to warn them if it's getting worse-

COBB
(gentle)
I didn't say it's getting worse. Look, Ariadne, I need them for this job. I need you for this job.
Without your help, I'll never get back to my children. And that's all I can care about right now.

ARIADNE
Why can't you go home, Cobb?
Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.
COBB
They think I killed her.
ARIADNE
How did she die?
Cobb thinks.

INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING-

COBB
Thank you.

ARIADNE
For what?

COBB
Not asking whether I did.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room, looking at FILES. Cobb presides.

COBB
The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to the Australian energy conglomerate, Fischer Morrow.

Cobb opens a large presentation pad.

COBB (reads aloud) "I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S EMPIRE."

Cobb turns to the team.
 

COBB
An idea Robert Fischer's conscious mind would never accept. We have to plant it deep in his subconscious.

ARTHUR
How deep?

COBB
Three levels down.
ARTHUR
A dream within a dream within a dream? Is that even possible?

COBB
Yes. It is.
COBB
Now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept.

ARTHUR
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?

COBB
That's what we have to figure out. Robert and his father have a tense relationship. Worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested...

EAMES
Do you play on that? Suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man?

COBB
No. Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We yearn for people to be reconciled, for catharsis. We need positive emotional logic.

Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.
EAMES
Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

COBB
That might work.
 

ARTHUR
Might? We'll have to do better than that.

EAMES
Thanks for the contribution, Arthur.

ARTHUR
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.

COBB
Inception's not about specificity. When we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find.

Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And we-

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection. Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.

EAMES
We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level.

COBB
How do you mean?
EAMES
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father....
Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
down we've accessed his ambition and self-esteem. We feed him: "I WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
Then, the bottom level, we bring out the emotional big guns...

COBB
"MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HIM."

EAMES
That could do it.
ARTHUR
How do you produce these emotional triggers?
 

EAMES
I forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of Peter Browning, a key figure in Fischer's emotional life.

Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.
ARTHUR
Are those yours?
Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.

ARTHUR
Yusuf?

YUSUF
Yup. Sorry.
COBB
Suppress them. We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people.

EAMES
Saito, when do I get to see Browning?

SAITO
You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday. We've arranged for you to spend several days...

INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors.

SAITO (V.O.)
...as part of a consulting litigation team working for Browning.

BROWNING
I'm not smelling settlement here-we take them down.

LAWYER
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation-

Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL.
 

BROWNING
Shall we relay your concerns directly to Maurice?

Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office. Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into-

INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted.

BROWNING
How is he?

Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.

BROWNING
I don't want to bother him unnecessarily but I know he-

FATHER
Robert! I've told you to keep out the damn!-

MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of
the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.
BROWNING
Must be a cherished memory of his-
FISCHER
I put it by his bed. He hasn't even noticed.

BROWNING
Robert, we have to talk about a power of attorney. I know this is hard for you, but it's important that we start to think about the future-

FISCHER
Not now, Uncle Peter.
Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.
EAMES (V.O.)
The vultures are circling. The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the stronger Peter Browning becomes...
 

Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move . INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...
EAMES (V.O.)
I've had time to learn Browning's physical presence and mannerisms...

In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK. INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
EAMES
Now, in the dream, I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind...
(draws a diagram)
Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him.

ARTHUR
(impressed)
So he gives himself the idea.
EAMES
Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. It has to seem self-generated.

ARTHUR
Eames, I'm impressed.
EAMES
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur.

CUT TO:
INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby, debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.

EAMES
He's not scheduled for surgery, no dental, nothing.

COBB
I thought he had some knee thing?
EAMES
Nothing they'd put him under for. Besides, we need a good ten hours.
 

SAITO
Sydney to Los Angeles.
They turn to Saito.
SAITO
Twelve hours and forty-five minutes-one of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks...

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.

COBB (V.O.)
Surely he flies private?
SAITO (V.O.)
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.

Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER. INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over.
ARTHUR
It'd have to be a 747.

COBB
Why?

ARTHUR
On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin.
We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant-

SAITO
We bought the airline.
Everyone turns to Saito.
SAITO
It seemed... neater.
COBB
Neater, huh?
(gets to his feet)
Well, now we have ten uninterrupted hours.
(MORE)
 
COBB (CONT'D)
(to Ariadne)
Nice lobby, by the way.

And we-

CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.
ARTHUR
My question is how we go down three layers with enough stability. Three layers down a little turbulence is gonna translate into an earthquake. The dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.

Yusuf clears his throat.
YUSUF
Sedation. For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.
YUSUF (V.O.)
We will have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative....

Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir. INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.
YUSUF
The compound we'll be using to share the dream is an advanced Somnacin derivative. It creates a very clear connection between dreamers, whilst actually accelerating brain function.

CUT TO:
COBB
Buying us more time in each level.
YUSUF
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.
(MORE)
 
YUSUF (CONT'D)
And when you go into a dream within that dream the effect is compounded.

ARIADNE
How much time?
YUSUF
Three dreams... that's ten hours, times twenty, times twenty, times twenty...

EAMES
Math was never my strong suit.
COBB
It's basically a week one layer down, six months two layers down-

ARIADNE
And ten years in the third level. Who wants to spend ten years in a dream?

YUSUF
Depends on the dream.
EAMES
It's not going to take us long to crack Fischer open once we get going. We'll be out in a couple days, max.

ARTHUR
How do we get out once we've made the plant?
(to Cobb)
I hope you've got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time.

Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb.

COBB
A kick.

ARIADNE
What's a kick?

Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS it- Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-

EAMES
That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
 

COBB
That feeling of falling which snaps you awake. We use that to jolt ourselves awake once we're done.

ARTHUR
But how are we going to feel that through the sedation?

YUSUF
That's the clever part. I customize the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.
YUSUF (O.S.)
To leave inner ear function unimpaired...

Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING just before he HITS the floor.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.
YUSUF
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side ...
YUSUF (V.O.)
Or tipping...
Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKE- INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur thinks this through.
ARTHUR
Even that won't cut through three
layers of deep sleep.
COBB
The trick is to devise a kick for each level, then synchronize them to get a snap that penetrates all three layers.
 

Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.
ARTHUR
We can use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is lying on one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechanism.
Ariadne stands over him. Watching.

She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, checking the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots the "B." The elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill at-

INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room, considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is a doll's house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Inside is a SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES her- she turns, looking through a doorway into another room...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking, arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation-

MAL
You remember when you asked me to marry you?

COBB
Of course...
MAL
You said you had a dream...
COBB
That we'd grow old together.
MAL
And we can. You know how to find me... you know what you have to do.

Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes- gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.
 

FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves towards her, leaving Mal.

COBB
You shouldn't be in here.
Cobb guides her back into the elevator.
ARIADNE
I wanted to know what "tests" you need to do on your own every night.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from us, building a SANDCASTLE.

ARIADNE
Why do you do this to yourself?
COBB
This is the only way I can still dream.

ARIADNE
Is it so important to dream?
Cobb stares at his family.
COBB
In my dreams... we're still together.
The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY. INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
The elevator descends.
ARIADNE
But these aren't just dreams, are they? They're memories. You said never to use memories.

COBB
And I shouldn't.
ARIADNE
You're keeping her alive.

COBB
No.
 

ARIADNE
You can't let her go.
COBB
No. These are moments I regret. Moments I turned into dreams so I could change them.

Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."
ARIADNE
What've you got buried down there that you regret?

Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button.
COBB
There's only one thing I need you to understand about me...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there, standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

ARIADNE
This is your house?
COBB
Mine and Mal's.
ARIADNE
Where is she?
COBB
She'd already died.

The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT- Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground.

COBB
It's James. My boy. He's found something. Maybe a worm.

A slightly older girl RUNS into view.
COBB
And there's Philippa.

She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US. They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.
 

COBB
I thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles... but I'm out of time-

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.
THIN MAN
Right now. Or never, Cobb.
Cobb nods, turns from the window-
COBB
Then I panic that I'll always wish I'd seen them turn, that I can't waste this chance...

Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...
COBB
But the moment's passed. And whatever I do, the dream's always the same... When I'm about to call... they run.

Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.
COBB
If I'm going to see their faces again-I've got to get back here in the real world...

Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS. INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps cautiously out into-

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)

DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table, STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps forwards- SMASH− she looks down to see that she has kicked over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN BILLOWS.

MAL (O.S.)
What are you doing here?
Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there.
 

ARIADNE
My name is-
MAL
I know who you are. What are you doing here?

ARIADNE
I don't know. Trying to understand.
MAL
How could you understand? Do you know what it is to be a lover? To be half of a whole?

ARIADNE
No.

Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...
MAL
I'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure...

Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.
MAL
But... it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?

COBB (O.S.)
Because you'll be together.
Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks at him.
MAL
How could you bring her here, Dom?
ARIADNE
What is this place?
COBB
A hotel. We spent our anniversaries in this suite.

ARIADNE
What happened here?
Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...
 

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against it AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHES-

MAL
you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE TOGETHER!-

COBB
We can. We will. But I need you to stay here for now-

MAL
YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-
Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.
COBB
I'll come back. I need you to stay here on your own for now. Just while I do this job. Then we can be together-

MAL
WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-
Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker open. He sees her watching him.

ARIADNE
You think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in? You think that's going to contain her?

The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.
SAITO
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
COBB
When's the funeral?
SAITO
Thursday. In Los Angeles.
 

COBB
Robert'll accompany the body Tuesday at the outside. We have to move.

Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.

ARIADNE
(low)
I'm coming with you.
COBB
No. I promised Miles.
ARIADNE
The team needs someone in there who understands what you're struggling with. If you don't want it to be me then you need to show Arthur what I just saw.

Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.
COBB
We need one more seat on the plane.
INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.

COBB
If I get on this plane and you haven't taken care of things... when we land I go to jail for the rest of my life.

SAITO
Complete the job en route, I make one phone call from the plane... you will have no trouble clearing immigration.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS

The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient, bag in hand, wearing black.

EAMES
Oh, sorry.
 

Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST. Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.
EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The 747 HURTLES down the runway.
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark. Cobb unbuckles, stands.

 

Excuse me?
Fischer looks up.
 
COBB
 

FISCHER
Yes?

COBB
I think this is yours...

Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands Fischer the passport.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Would you gentlemen care for a drink?

FISCHER
Water.

COBB
Same.

Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.
FISCHER
Well, thank you.
COBB
No problem. Look, I couldn't help noticing your name. You're not related to Maurice Fischer?

Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.
FISCHER
Actually, he was my father.
 

COBB
I'm very sorry for your loss. He was an inspiring figure.

The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.

COBB
Thanks.

As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.

COBB
To Maurice Fischer. (they drink)
I'll leave you in peace.
Fischer grants him a smile. EXT. 747 - LATER
The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape. INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain. Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.

Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.

Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes. The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-

CUT TO:
INT. SEDAN - DAY

Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS down. Cobb pulls over-

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.
 

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.
ARTHUR
(indicates rain)
Couldn't you have peed before you went under?

YUSUF
Sorry.

The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.
EAMES
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf?

YUSUF
Ha bloody ha.
COBB
At least we know he'll be looking for a cab in this.

INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.

COBB
Brace yourselves.

Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-

CABDRIVER
Hey, asshole! Why don't you try driving without your thumb up-

He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

COBB
Walk away.

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both cars pull away.

INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign. Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing rain from his shoulders.
 

FISCHER
Third and Market. Snappy.
Eames JUMPS in from the other side.
FISCHER
What're you doing?
EAMES
Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe we could share.

FISCHER
Maybe not.

Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.

FISCHER
Great.

Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it at Eames.

FISCHER
(contemptuous)
There's 500 dollars in there. And the wallet's worth more than that. For that you ought to at least drop me at my stop.

Eames smiles at this.
EAMES
I'm afraid-

A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT IMPACTS by Saito-

EAMES
Get us out of here!

Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in front, BLOCKING the path-

A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-

COBB
Come on!-

Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
 

A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN
advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab. Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-

Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-
ARIADNE
This wasn't in the design-

Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the train-

A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain, raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-

Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-

Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND- YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-

Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-

Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-

ARTHUR
Everybody okay? Saito?

Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered in BLOOD.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps out− PULLS the shutter down behind them-

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him through a doorway. Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.

COBB
Arthur! Arthur what the-
Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.
COBB
Oh, Christ. Is he dying?
 

ARTHUR
I don't know. What happened back there? Where were you?

COBB
We were blocked by a freight train.
ARTHUR
(to Ariadne)
Why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection?

ARIADNE
I didn't.

COBB
(snaps)
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?! Those weren't regular projections- they'd been trained!

ARIADNE
How could they be trained?
ARTHUR
Fischer's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself. His subconscious is militarized. It should've shown on the research-

COBB
So why the hell didn't it?!

ARTHUR
Calm down.

COBB
Don't tell me to calm down-you were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly. You can't make this kind of mistake-we're not prepared for this kind of violence-

ARTHUR
Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security before. We just have to be more-

COBB
This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur! (points at Saito)
He's dying!
EAMES
So we put him out of his misery.
 

Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over Saito.

COBB
No.

EAMES
He's in agony. Let's wake him up-
Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.

 

No!
 
COBB
(they lock eyes)
 
It won't wake him up.
EAMES
What do you mean, it won't wake him? When you die in a dream you wake up.

YUSUF
Not from this. We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.

Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.
EAMES
So what happens if one of us dies?
COBB
That person doesn't wake up. Their mind drops into Limbo.

ARIADNE
Limbo?

ARTHUR
Unconstructed dream space.
ARIADNE
What's down there?
ARTHUR
Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before. On this team... just Cobb.

ARIADNE
How long would we be stuck there?
 

YUSUF
You couldn't even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases-

EAMES
How long?

YUSUF
Decades-it could be infinite-I don't know! Ask him-he's the one who's been there before!

Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.
EAMES
Great. So now we're stuck in Fischer's mind battling it out with his private army, and if we get hit we're stuck in Limbo 'til our brains dissolve into scrambled egg?

Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.
ARTHUR
Let's just get him upstairs.
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines him. He motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb.

ARTHUR
Hold this. Firm pressure.
Arthur turns to Cobb.
ARTHUR
You knew the risks and you didn't tell us.

COBB
There wasn't meant to be any risk. We weren't supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre.

ARTHUR
You had no right.
COBB
It's the only way you can go three layers deep, Arthur.

Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.
 

ARTHUR
And you. You went along with this?
YUSUF
I trusted him.
ARTHUR
You trusted him? When? When he promised you half his share?

YUSUF
(offended)
No! His whole share. Plus, he told me he'd done it before.

Arthur turns to Cobb.
ARTHUR
Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb?

Cobb grabs Arthur.
COBB
You don't know anything about that. This was the only way to do this job, Arthur. I did what I had to do to get back to my children.

EAMES
So you led us into a war zone with no way out.

COBB
We have a way out. The kick. We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick.

EAMES
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I'm sitting it out on this level.

COBB
You'll never make it, Eames. Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak. The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level−you'll never make it without getting killed. Downwards is the only way forwards. We have to carry on.

Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-
 

COBB
And we have to do it fast.
Eames and Arthur weigh this.
COBB
Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's get in there and soften him up.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER

Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator.

FISCHER
I'm insured against kidnapping up to ten million-this'll be simple-

COBB
No, it won't.
Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.
ARTHUR
In. your lather's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe. We need the combination.

FISCHER
I never noticed a safe-
COBB
Doesn't mean you don't know the combination.

FISCHER
Well, I don't.
ARTHUR
We have it on good authority that you do.

FISCHER
Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.

YUSUF
Five hundred dollars, this cost?
EAMES
What's inside?
 

YUSUF
Cash, cards, ID... and this-

Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's office− YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.

EAMES
Useful?

Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.

COBB
You're on. You've got an hour.
EAMES
An hour? I was supposed to have all night to crack him.

COBB
And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside. You've got an hour-get something we can use.

Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-
FISCHER
What's that?
ARTHUR
Good authority.
Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice.
FISCHER
Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-
ARTHUR
The combination.
FISCHER
I don't know it!
ARTHUR
Why would Browning tell us you did?
FISCHER
Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
 

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.

COBB
You've got an hour. Get talking.
Cobb leaves.
BROWNING (EAMES)
They've had me for two days. They've got someone with access to your father's office and they're trying to open his safe-they thought I'd know the combination, but I don't-

FISCHER
Neither do I, Uncle Peter.
BROWNING
(confused)
Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it.

FISCHER
He never gave me the combination.
Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something.
BROWNING
He did, he just didn't tell you that it was a combination.

FISCHER
What, then?
BROWNING
Something only you would know. Some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with Maurice-

FISCHER
We didn't have a lot of meaningful experiences together.

BROWNING
Perhaps after your mother died...
FISCHER
After my mother died, I went to him in my grief.
(MORE)
 
FISCHER (CONT'D)
You know what he told me? "There's really nothing to be said, Robert."

BROWNING
He always had a hard time with emotional-

FISCHER
I was eleven, Uncle Peter.
Browning (Eames) takes this in.
BROWNING
He loved you, Robert. In his way.
FISCHER
"In his way?" At the end he called me to his deathbed. He could barely speak, but he took the trouble to say one last thing to me. He pulled me close... I could make out only one word. "Disappointed."

Browning can say nothing.
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is breathing fast, shallow.

COBB
How's he doing?
ARIADNE
He's in a lot of pain.
Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye.
COBB
When we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense.

Saito nods, breathing hard.

ARIADNE
(low)
And if he dies?
COBB
His conscious mind will drop out of the dream. He'll be trapped in Limbo for a lifetime...

ARIADNE
What will that do to him?
 

Cobb looks at her. Grave.
COBB
When he wakes... his mind could be completely gone.

SAITO
When... when we wake I will still honor our arrangement...

Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.
COBB
Saito-san, when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement. You'll have forgotten this world. Limbo will be your reality. Lost there so long, you'll have become an old man...

SAITO
Filled with regret?
COBB
Waiting to die alone. Yes.
SAITO
Then I'll take the chance and come back. And we'll be young men together again.

Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.
ARIADNE
When were you trapped in Limbo?
Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.
ARIADNE
Cobb, you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job. But they don't know the truth.

COBB
What truth?
ARIADNE
The truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting up through your subconscious.
(MORE)
 
ARIADNE (CONT'D)
The truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you-and I'm not sure we're going to like what we find there.

Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing.
ARIADNE
This is not just about Fischer, it's about you. Tell me what happened to you and Mal. Trapped in Limbo.

Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through.
COBB
We were on a job. Exploring dreams within dreams. But we didn't understand how your mind can turn hours into years. How you can get trapped. Trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of your subconscious...

INSERT CUT: MAL LIES ON THE SAND, STARING UP AT A CLOUDLESS SKY, WAVES WASHING OVER HER...

COBB
You can lose track of what's real.
ARIADNE
How long were you stuck?
Cobb pauses before he answers. Looks at Ariadne.
COBB
Fifty years.
Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.
ARIADNE
How did you stand it?
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL BUILD A SANDCASTLE ON THE BEACH...
COBB
We built. We created a whole world for ourselves...

INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL WALK THROUGH A DESERTED CITY.
COBB
It's not so bad at first, being gods. The problem is knowing that it's not real. It became impossible for me to live like that.
 

ARIADNE
But not for her?
COBB
She accepted it. At some point...
INSERT CUT:
INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE. Inside is a SAFE. She opens it- it is empty. She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.

COBB (V.O.)
...she'd decided to forget that our world wasn't real.

Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
ARIADNE
And when you finally woke up?
COBB
To wake from that. From decades lived. To be old souls thrown back into youth. It was hard. At first Mal seemed okay. But I started to realize something was wrong.
Finally she admitted it. This idea she was possessed by. This simple little idea that changed everything...

ARIADNE
What was it?
COBB
That our world was not real. No matter what I did, no matter what I said, she was convinced that we were still in a dream. That we needed to wake up again...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.
COBB (V.O.)
That to get home we'd have to kill ourselves.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.
 

ARIADNE
What about your children?
Cobb has to look away.
COBB
She... she believed they weren't real. That our real children were waiting. Somewhere above...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of the room, FACES UNSEEN-

COBB
Calm down, Mal-
MAL
They're projections, Dom. Your dreams. I'm their mother-don't you think I can tell the difference?

Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter tears.

COBB
If it's my dream then why can't I control it? Why can't I stop this?

MAL
(it's obvious)
You don't know you're dreaming.
COBB
You keep telling me I am-
MAL
And you don't believe me!
COBB (V.O.)
She was certain. But she loved me too much to go without me. So she made a plan...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.
COBB (V.O.)
For our anniversary...
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED BEDCLOTHES.
 

He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it, thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The CURTAIN BILLOWS.

EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.

MAL
Join me.

COBB
Mal, come back inside.
MAL
No. I'm going to jump. And you're coming with me.

COBB
No, I'm not. This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die. Let's go back inside and talk about this, please.

MAL
We've talked enough.
She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.
MAL
Come out onto the ledge or I'll jump right now.

She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.

MAL
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.

COBB
I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave our children.

MAL
If I go without you, they'll take them away, anyway.

COBB
What do you mean?
 

MAL
I filed a letter with our attorney. Explaining how I'm fearful for my safety, how you've threatened to kill me...

Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...
MAL (CONT’D)
I love you, Dom. I’ve freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We’re going home to our real children.

COBB
Out children are here, Mal.
Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...
MAL
You’re waiting for a train...
COBB
NO! MAL, NO, I CAN’T!
MAL
A train that will take you far away...

COBB DON’T DO THIS!

MAL
You know where you hope this train will take you, you can’t know for sure...

COBB
DON’T!

MAL
But it doesn’t matter...

COBB
NO!

MAL
Because you’ll be together...

Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then tries to bury his face in the wall...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY
Cobb stares as he remembers.
 

COBB
He letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew I’d make...

INT. COBB AND MAL’S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.
COBB (V.O.)
She’d had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.

Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES, Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...

COBB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It was impossible for me to explain the nature of her madness...

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb’s hand.
THIN MAN
Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.

COBB (V.O.)
So I ran. And I’ve been running ever since, trying to buy my way back to my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY
Cobb looks across at Ariadne.
ARIADNE
Psychiatrists judged her sane?
COBB
She was sane. She was just lost in the labyrinth.

ARIADNE
Then why should you blame yourself?
COBB
Because we were a family. And we had a life I would do anything to get back to now. But that reality wasn’t enough for me then.
 

ARIADNE
It might have been your idea to push the limits, Cobb. But you’re not responsible for the idea that destroyed her. The idea that her world wasn’t real... that was her own idea from her own mind.

Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE (CONT’D)
Your guilt defines her. Powers her. If we’re going to succeed in this, you’re going to have to forgive yourself, and you’re going to have to confront her. But you don’t have to do it alone.

COBB
You don’t have to do this for me-
ARIADNE
I’m doing it for the others. They don’t know the risk they’ve taken coming in here with you.

Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a position. Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.

COBB
We can’t stay here. Arthur?!
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Browning puts his hand on Fischer’s shoulder.
BROWNING
These people are going to kill us if we don’t give them the combination.

FISCHER
They won’t, they’ll try to ransom us-

BROWNING
I heard them-they’re going to lock us in and run the can into the river.

FISCHER
What is in the safe?
 

BROWNING
Something for you. Maurice always said it was his most previous gift... a will.

FISCHER
Maurice’s will is with Port and Dunn.

BROWNING
It’s an alternate. It supersedes the other only if you want it to.

FISCHER
What does it say?
BROWNING
It splits all the component businesses of Fischer Morrow into individual companies, transferring ownership to the boards of those companies...

FISCHER
Leaving me nothing?
BROWNING
A basic living. Nothing more. The entire empire would cease to exist.

FISCHER
Destroy my own inheritance? Why would he suggest such a thing?

BROWNING
I don’t know, Robert.
Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him.
COBB
Come to your senses?
FISCHER
Let us go. I don’t know the combination. Not consciously.

Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his gun.
COBB
Let’s try instinctively. I have someone standing in your father’s office ready to tap in a combination.

He holds the phone to Fischer’s mouth.
 

COBB (CONT’D)
First six numbers that come into your head. Right now.

FISCHER
I have no idea-
Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-

COBB
RIGHT NOW!

FISCHER
Five, two, eight... four, nine, one.

Cobb lowers his weapon. Listens to the phone. Shakes his head. Shuts the phone.

COBB
You’ll have to do better. Bag ‘em.
Arthur puts SACKS over their heads. INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-
FISCHER
We’re worth much more to you alive...

Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to drop LIQUID onto Fischer’s mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARDS. “Browning” yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.

EAMES
(excited)
His relationship with his father’s much worse that we thought.

ARTHUR
That helps us?
Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.
COBB
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.

Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.
ARTHUR
But how do you reconcile them if they’re that estranged?
 

EAMES
I’m working on that.
Arthur lines up a shot through the window-
ARTHUR
Well, work fast-Fischer’s projections are closing in quick, we need to break out of here before we’re totally boxed in...

Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his bandages. Arthur can’t get the last sniper- he’s too hidden behind a wall-

EAMES
Shouldn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, Arthur-

Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

EAMES (CONT’D)
Shall we?

They climb into the van-
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-

COBB
Shifting Fischer’s antipathy from his father onto Browning should work.

EAMES
We need the imagery, the words...
ARIADNE
So you destroy his one positive relationship?

COBB
No. We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather’s true nature.

EAMES
Hell, we should be charging Fischer as much as Saito.
 

ARTHUR
What about his security? It’s going to get worse as we go deeper.

COBB
We bring in Mr. Charles.

ARTHUR
No.

EAMES
Who’s Mr. Charles?
ARTHUR
A bad idea.
COBB
Arthur, the second we approach Fischer in that hotel, they’re gonna mow us down-we run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.

EAMES
So you’ve done it before?
ARTHUR
Sure. But it didn’t work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

Eames takes this in.
EAMES
You learned a lot, though. Right?
COBB
(to Eames) I’ll need a decoy.

EAMES
No problem. How about a pretty young lady I’ve used before?

COBB
Fine-

Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.
COBB (CONT’D)
(to Yusuf)
I know you’ve got to stay ahead of them, but drive with kid gloves, okay? The world down there is going to be very unstable-
 

ARTHUR
And don’t make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back, we have to be ready to catch it-

YUSUF
I’ll use the music to let you know when it’s coming, but the rest is up to you.

Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.
YUSUF (CONT’D)
Everyone ready?
Nods all round.
YUSUF (CONT’D)
Sweet dreams-
Yusuf hits a button and we-

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET
Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking.
BLONDE (O.S.)
Am I boring you?
Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.
BLONDE (CONT’D)
I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn’t to your liking.

FISCHER
I have a lot on my mind.

Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.

ARTHUR
And there goes Mr. Charles.
ARIADNE
Who or what, exactly, is Mr. Charles?
 

ARTHUR
It’s a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer’s Sub- security.

COBB
Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again. Rod Green, Marketing.
(to Blonde) And you must be...

BLONDE
Leaving.

She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.

BLONDE (CONT’D)
In case you get bored.
Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.
COBB
I think you just got blown off... unless her phone number really does have only six digits.

Fischer glances at the napkin: “528-491.” INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.
ARIADNE
And why don’t you approve?
ARTHUR
Because it involves telling the mark that he’s dreaming. Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.

ARIADNE
Didn’t Cobb say never to do that?
ARTHUR
You must’ve noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
 

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb turns to Fischer.
COBB
Strange way to make friends. (off look)
Lifting your wallet, I mean.

Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.

FISCHER
Goddamn it. The wallet alone’s worth-

COBB
Five hundred bucks. I know. Don’t worry, my guys are on it.

FISCHER
Who did you say you were?
Fischer looks at him, curious. Cobb plows on, confident-
COBB
I said I was Rod Green from Marketing-but I’m not. My name is Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar to you. I’m in charge of your security here.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-
BLONDE
Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?

She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as the Sub-security approaches...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
The Blonde fondles Saito’s lapels, getting close.
SAITO
I’m sorry, but...

Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of infinite reflections created by the elevator’s opposing mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES. He winks.

SAITO (CONT’D)
(pushing him away) Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
 

EAMES
You look a bit perkier.
A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.
SAITO
Turbulence on the plane.
EAMES
Feels closer. That’s Yusuf’s driving.

And we-

CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN
FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror, FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - NIGHT

As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb trying to place him.

FISCHER
Security? You work for the hotel?
COBB
No. My specialty is subconscious security.

FISCHER
You’re talking about dreams. You’re talking about extraction.

COBB
Exactly. My job is to protect you...

Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES. Pauses, looks across the bar- HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...

Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-
 

COBB (CONT’D)
My job is to protect you from any attempt to access your mind through your dreams.

Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest... INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Eames pulls out Fischer’s wallet, moves to hand it to Saito, then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cast to find... The SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his father blowing on it. The elevator doors open and Eames steps off. HANDS Saito the wallet.

EAMES
Get off at a different floor and keep moving. Dump the wallet, then meet me in the lobby. The security will try to track it down. We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

The doors close. Saito puts the wallet in his pocket. He COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks over Fischer’s shoulder to see a SUITED MAN watching him. Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.

COBB
You’re not safe here.
Cobb steps away from the bar. Fischer does not move.
COBB (CONT’D)
Trust me. They’re coming for you.
Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER ECHOES, and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUN-

WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR’S SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET
Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-
 

COBB
Strange weather, huh?
A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-
COBB (CONT’D)
You feel that?
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the windows. Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather, PUZZLED. Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.

ARIADNE
What’s happening?
ARTHUR
Cobb’s drawing Fischer’s attention to the strangeness of the dream.
That’s making his subconscious look for the dreamer. For me.

And we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

At the end of the alley- Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD RIGHT TURN- we move into EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and we-

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

The liquid in Fischer’s drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.

COBB
Very odd-the weather, the
gravity...

Fischer looks around the bar- it’s as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...

COBB (CONT’D)
But I can explain all this. You’ve actually been trained for this.
(Fischer nods)
Think of the strangeness of the weather, the shifts in gravity. None of this is real...
(MORE)
 
COBB (CONT’D)
(beat)
We’re in a dream.

Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.

COBB (CONT’D)
The simplest test of what I’m saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel... okay?

Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach.

COBB (CONT’D)
Breathe. Remember the training. Accept the fact that we’re in a dream. That’s why I’m here protecting you.

As Fischer considers this we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street, swerving through traffic and we-

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING
The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT- FISCHER
So you... you’re not real?
The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.
COBB
No. I’m a projection of your subconscious. I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream. I believe that’s what has happened.

Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-
 

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them- The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up the stairs- then PUSHES him into-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-

FISCHER
Hey-

Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-

BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and SHOOTS the First Man.

FISCHER (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing.
COBB
Look at the gun in his hand.

Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb opens the First Man’s jacket to show Fischer his holster and sidearm.

COBB (CONT’D)
These men were sent to abduct you.
Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.
COBB (CONT’D)
If I’m going to help you, I need you to be calm.

Fischer remembers something.
FISCHER
If this is a dream, I have to kill myself and wake up-

Fischer raises the gun towards his head-
COBB
I wouldn’t do that-they’ve probably got you sedated. If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state.
(MORE)
 
COBB (CONT'D)
Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it...

Fischer lowers his gun.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man. Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and DROPS Fischer’s WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491. INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS
Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.

ARTHUR
So, if everything’s correct, this room should be directly below 528.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.
COBB
What do you remember from before this dream?

FISCHER
(thinking)
Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter. (looks up)
Christ-we’ve been kidnapped.
COBB
Where were they holding you?
FISCHER
They had us... in the back of a van...

COBB
Your body’s bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts.

FISCHER
It was... to do with a safe... Christ, why’s it so hard to remember?
 

COBB
It’s like trying to remember a dream after you’ve woken up. It takes years of practice to do it easily. So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind. What?

FISCHER
They wanted a combination to a safe... they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.

COBB
That’s them extracting a locator.

FISCHER
A locator?

COBB
A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways...
(thinking)
This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them?

FISCHER
5, 2... something... it was a long number. 528... 528, 4 something.

COBB
(opens phone)
Well, we know where to start. (into phone)
Fifth floor.
INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair, attaching the explosives to the ceiling.

ARIADNE
Do you use a timer?
ARTHUR
No, I have to judge it myself. Once you’re all asleep up in room 528, I wait ‘til Yusuf starts his kick...

ARIADNE
How will you know?
 

ARTHUR
His music warns me it’s coming, then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that’s when I blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick. Too soon, and we won’t get pulled out; too late and I won’t be able to drop us.

ARIADNE
Why not?

ARTHUR
The van will be in free fall. I can’t drop us with no gravity.

Arthur finishes setting the charges. INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames.

SAITO
I see you’ve changed.

BROWNING
I’m sorry?

Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito’s eye.
SAITO
I’m... I mistook you for a friend.
BROWNING
Good-looking fellow, I’m sure.
Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames.
EAMES
That’s Fischer’s projection of Browning. We’ll keep an eye on how he behaves-

SAITO
Why?

EAMES
How he acts will tell us if Fischer’s starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
 

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are waiting in the corridor.

COBB
They work for me.

Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.

INT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-

ARTHUR
Mr. Charles!
Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.
COBB
You know what this is?
Fischer’s eyes roam over the dials and plungers.
FISCHER
I think so. But I don’t understand.
COBB
They were going to put you under.
FISCHER
I’m already under.
COBB
Under again.
FISCHER
A dream within a dream?

ARTHUR
Shhhh!

Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun in their face. IT IS BROWNING.

Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.
FISCHER
Uncle Peter. What’s going on?
Cobb pulls the key from Browning’s hand: ROOM 528.
 

COBB
You said you were kidnapped together?

FISCHER
Not exactly, they already had him. They’d been torturing him...

COBB
You saw them torture him?
Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.
FISCHER
The kidnappers are working for you.
BROWNING
No, Robert-
FISCHER
You’re trying to get that safe open. To get the alternate will.

Browning looks up at Fischer.
BROWNING
Fischer Morrow’s been my entire life. I can’t let you destroy it.

FISCHER
I’m not going to throw away my inheritance. Why would I?

BROWNING
I couldn’t take the chance of you rising to your father’s final taunt.

FISCHER
What taunt?
BROWNING
That will. I’m sorry, Robert, but it’s his final insult. A challenge to build something for yourself.
He’s telling you that you aren’t worthy of his achievements.

Fischer takes this in. Devastated.
FISCHER
That he was “disappointed?”
 

BROWNING
I’m so sorry. But he was wrong. You’ll make his company even greater than he ever could.

COBB
Your godfather’s lying, Robert.
Fischer turns to Cobb.
FISCHER
How do you know?
COBB
It’s what I do. He’s hiding something.

Cobb looks at Browning.
COBB
Let’s find out what.

Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism. Browning watches. Silent.

COBB
Let’s do to him what he was going to do to you.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.
COBB
We’ll penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesn’t want you to know.

Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve, offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other- Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.

ARTHUR
He’s out.

ARIADNE
Wait, Cobb-I’m lost. Whose subconscious are we going into?

COBB
Fischer’s. I told him it was Browning’s so he’d come with us as part of our team.

ARTHUR
(impressed)
He’s going to help us break into his own subconscious.
 

COBB
That’s the idea. He’ll think that his security is Browning’s and fight them to learn the truth about his father.

Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one by one. Cobb is last.

COBB
Fischer’s subconscious is going to run you down hard.

ARTHUR
I’ll lead them on a merry chase.
COBB
Be back in time for the kick.

ARTHUR
I’m on it.

Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains, BILLOWING like those in Mal’s suite- a GLIMPSE of someone (Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY
CLOSE ON Cobb’s face, staring. Fixed.
ARIADNE (O.S.)
Cobb? Cobb?

Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.

ARIADNE
What’s down there?
COBB
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.

ARIADNE
I meant what’s down there for you?

Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer’s earshot.

COBB
You’re the dreamer. I need you to draw the security away from the complex.
 

EAMES
Then who guides Fischer in? You?
COBB
If I know the route... we could be compromised.

Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.
ARIADNE
I designed the place.
COBB
No. You’re with me.
SAITO (O.S.)
I could do it.
They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.
COBB
Eames, brief Saito on the route into the complex. What we’re looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section.
That north tower.

Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD on the snow. Looks at Saito.

COBB
Mr. Fischer, you’re going in with Mr. Saito.

FISCHER
You’re not coming in?
COBB
You have to do this on your own. You have to get in there, break into your godfather’s mind and find out the truth about your father.

Cobb taps Fischer’s radio mike.
COBB
Keep this live at all times. I’ll be listening in, covering you.
(holds up the sniper rifle)
The windows on the upper floors are big enough that I can cover you from that south tower.
 

Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.

CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder. He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor...

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf’s window as the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused MARKET-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding up. The BOOMS are louder, and we-

CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van- the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V., tossing the rider like a rag doll-

Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the van’s side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING-
as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into-

The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we-

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur and the Security Man DROP to the floor, Arthur on top. Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-

YUSUF
Bugger.

Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the barrier onto the bridge-

The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security Man inside starts FIRING on the van...

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Arthur RACES down the steps- OPENS the door to the fourth floor- spots SECURITY MEN outside room 491.

ARTHUR
Hey!

They TURN- he DARTS back into the stairwell- RACES down the stairs- the Security Men follow- they start SHOOTING, and we-

CUT TO:
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.
 

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS out on skis and SNOWMOBILES to investigate.

Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-

CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the
S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND HAND TICKING SLOWLY...

YUSUF
Sod it. I hope your ready.

He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur’s head. As he does so, he notices Saito’s bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAY- Edith Piaf’s “Non, je ne regrette rien” starts up and we-

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL TONES- he looks up PANICKED-

No, Yusuf. Too soon!
SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-
CUT TO:

Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
Cobb? Are you hearing that?
Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW. EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a patrol passes beneath his position.
 

EAMES
I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at first I thought it was just wind...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb is listening intently. The “wind” changes pitch.
COBB
No, it’s music. Dammit.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
What do we do?
COBB
We move fast. Saito, did you copy?
EXT. MOUNTAINS, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-
SAITO
We’re going as fast as we can.
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.
ARIADNE
How long do we have?
COBB
Yusuf’s about ten seconds from the jump, which gives Arthur about three minutes, which gives us about-

ARIADNE
Sixty minutes.
COBB
The route you gave them, can they do it in under an hour?

ARIADNE
I don’t think so. They’ve still got to climb down to the middle terrace.

COBB
They need a new route-a direct route.

ARIADNE
The building’s designed as a labyrinth.
 

COBB
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
(into radio) Eames?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Sub- security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb turns to Ariadne.
COBB
Did Eames add any features?

ARIADNE
Yes.

COBB
What did he add?
Ariadne looks at Cobb.
ARIADNE
I shouldn’t tell you. If Mal-
COBB
There’s no time-what did he add?
ARIADNE
Utility closets, trap doors...
COBB
What about service features? Did he add any large pipes or-

ARIADNE
Ducts. He added an air duct system- it doesn’t follow the maze. They can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower.

COBB
Explain it to them.
ARIADNE
(into radio) Saito?

INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and- IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs.

ARTHUR
Paradox.

Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we-

Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex.
ARIADNE
What was that?

Cobb? Did we miss it?
COBB
Yeah, we missed it.
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames is lying on the snow.

Finish the job before the next kick.
 

EAMES
What next kick?
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio.
COBB
When the van hits the water. I figure Arthur’s got a couple minutes and we’ve got about twenty.

Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex. EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van seems SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR TEN STORIES ABOVE THE RIVER... and we-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

In ZERO GRAVITY, Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491, opens it. He looks at the charges planted on the ceiling.

He PULLS the charges from the ceiling. Hurrying. And we-

Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system. Saito is falling behind, coughing up blood.

Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.
 

ARIADNE
(she points)
That’s the antechamber outside the strongroom.

Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber.
COBB
What about the strongroom? Doesn’t it have any windows?

ARIADNE
Wouldn’t be very strong if it did. (off look)
Look, if you wanted to design it yourself-

COBB
It’s fine. Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there.

Cobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne watches through binoculars, appalled.

ARIADNE
These projections, they’re part of his subconscious?

COBB
Yeah.

ARIADNE
Are you destroying those parts of his mind?

COBB
No, of course not. They’re just projections.

Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the anteroom. Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls out his radio. Fischer looks at him- he is PALE, SHIVERING. Fischer takes the radio, WHISPERS into it.

Cobb looks at Ariadne-
ARIADNE
Cobb, she’s just a projection. Fischer... he’s real.

Cobb thinks. Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED.

Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes- INT. ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.
 

EAMES
What happened?
ARIADNE
Mal killed Fischer-
COBB
I wouldn’t shoot her.

Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer’s jacket open-

COBB
It won’t do any good-
Eames SHOCKS Fischer’s chest...
COBB
Even if you could revive his body, his mind’s trapped down there. It’s over.

Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.
EAMES
So that it, then? We failed.

COBB
I’m sorry.

EAMES
It’s you who doesn’t get back to your family.

Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors.
EAMES
I wanted to know what was going to happen in there. I think we had this one.

ARIADNE
There’s still a way: We follow Fischer down-

They look at her.
EAMES
We’re almost out of time-
ARIADNE
Down there they’ll be enough time. We’ll find him-soon as you hear Arthur’s music start, you use the defibrillator to revive him-we give him his own early kick from below.
(MORE)
 
ARIADNE (CONT'D)
Get him in there- (points to doors)
Then, as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers.

Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.
EAMES
Okay, Saito can hold them off while I plant the rest of the charges.

COBB
Saito’s not going to last, Eames.
ARIADNE
We have to try!
EAMES
Go for it, but I’m taking the kick whether you’re back or not...

Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-

ARIADNE
Can I trust you to do what’s needed? Mal’s down there-

COBB
And I can find her. She’ll have Fischer.

ARIADNE
How do you know?
COBB
She wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve. Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button- WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-

EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up at the crumbling city around them.

ARIADNE
This is your world?
 

COBB
It was. And this is where she'll be.

And we-

CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety systems of the elevator, we move into SLOW MOTION, the fireballs FLAMING OUT in graceful licks and we-

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct- pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.

EAMES
Come on, Saito. I need you to cover Fischer while I plant the charges.

Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the window− pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...
Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-
EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COAST (LIMBO)- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the extraordinary collection of buildings− every architectural style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.

ARIADNE
You built all this?
COBB
We both did.
 

ARIADNE
It's incredible.
COBB
We built for years. Then, when that got stale, we started in on the memories.

A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons, prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.

Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.

COBB
This is our neighborhood.
ARIADNE
(confused) From what city?

COBB
No. Our neighborhood. (pointing)
That was our first apartment... then we moved to that building... we got that small house when Mal became pregnant.

ARIADNE
You reconstructed them all from memory?

COBB
We had time.
Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.
ARIADNE
What's that?
COBB
The house Mal grew up in.
ARIADNE
Will she be in there?
COBB
No. Come on-
Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.
 

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the elevators.

COBB
We both wanted a house, but we both loved skyscrapers. In the real world we had to choose. Not here.

INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of bullets.

ARIADNE
How do we send Fischer back?
COBB
We need some kind of kick.

ARIADNE
What?

COBB
I'll improvise.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.

COBB
There's something you have to understand about me. About inception. You see, an idea is like a virus...

Cobb leads her out of the lift... INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS
Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the corridor towards the back of the house...

COBB
Resilient...
(turns to Ariadne)
Highly contagious, and an idea can grow. The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world...

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of Limbo stretching off behind it.
 

MAL
The smallest idea, such as... "Your world is not real."

Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal.
MAL
A simple little thought that changes everything...

Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal. And we-

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry. It is only now that we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE. Mal looks at Ariadne.

MAL
So certain of your world. Of what's real. Do you think he is-
(points at Cobb)
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

COBB
I know what's real.
MAL
What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream? Mutable laws of physics? Tell that to the quantum physicists. Reappearance of the dead? What about heaven and hell? Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah? They crucified Christ, didn't they?

COBB
I know what's real.
MAL
No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces? The way the projections persecute the dreamer?
 

Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying.
MAL
Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose.
Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me.

COBB
(rising anger)
I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us.

MAL
You're wrong, Dom. You're confused... our children are here-

A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches, moved. Mal leans in close.

MAL
(whispers)
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom?

COBB
Our real children are waiting for me up above.

And we-

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it. He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-

Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness...
And we-

Mal laughs at Cobb.
MAL
(laughs)
Up above? Listen to yourself. You judged me for believing the very same thing.

Mal points at the children-
MAL
These are our children. Watch. (turns to the kids)
Hey, James! Philippa?!
The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.
COBB
They're not real, Mal. Our real children are waiting for us-

The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes.
MAL
You keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it-

COBB
I know it-

MAL
And what if you're wrong? What if I'm what's real?

Cobb is silent.
MAL
You keep telling yourself what you know... but what do you believe?
What do you feel?
Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling.
COBB
Guilt. I feel guilt. And however confused I might get.
(MORE)
 
COBB (CONT'D)
However lost I might seem... it's always there. Telling me something. Reminding me of the truth.

MAL
What truth?
COBB
That you were wrong to doubt our world. That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie...

MAL
How could you know it was a lie?
COBB
Because it was my lie.
MAL
(realizing)
Because you planted the idea in my mind.

COBB
Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards...

ARIADNE
Why?

COBB
We'd become lost in here. Living in a world of infinite possibilities. A world where we were gods. I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world...

INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.

COBB
I couldn't make Mal understand that we needed to break free. To die. So I started to search our world...

Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...
INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...
COBB
Searching for the right place in her mind...
 

INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside...

COBB
And when I found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, I broke it open...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes to the doll's house...

COBB
I broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea.

INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side.

COBB
A truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget...

INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe. IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the
safe...
COBB
That her world was not real.

INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING THROUGH WASTELAND.

COBB (V.O.)
That death was a necessary escape.

They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-

COBB
You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter...

Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks. Replies-
MAL
Because you'll be together.
The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.

Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes. She is crying.
 

COBB
I never thought that the idea I'd planted would grow in her mind like a cancer. That even after we woke...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused. He moves to the CURTAINS... Mal is on the ledge opposite.

COBB
You'd continue to believe that your world was not real...

Crying, Mal nods-
MAL
That death was the only escape?
INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.
MAL
You killed me.
Cobb looks at Mal. Whispers-
COBB
I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.
Mal comes in close to Cobb. Looks him over.
MAL
You infected my mind. You betrayed me. But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together... right here. In our world. The world we built together.

We need Fischer.

You can't have him.
Cobb stares at Mal. Mesmerized.
COBB
If I stay, can she take him back?
ARIADNE
Cobb, what are you saying?
MAL
Fischer's on the porch.
ARIADNE
Cobb, you can't do this.
COBB
Go check he's alive, Ariadne.

Ariadne moves onto the porch, high above the metropolis, and we-

Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the sky... she looks down to see Fischer, BOUND AND BLOODY, lying below the rail.

ARIADNE
He's here. And it's time. But you have to come with us.

Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-
ARIADNE
Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose yourself in here! You have to get back to your children!

COBB
Send Fischer, I have to stay-
ARIADNE
You can't stay here to be with her-
Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.
COBB
I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That means he's here. I have to stay here and find him.

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail. Cobb looks back at Mal.

COBB
I can't stay here to be with her because she's not real.

Mal looks at Cobb, furious.
MAL
Not real? I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore. Here-doesn't this feel real, Dom?

She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at Mal-
 

COBB
I wish you were. But I couldn't make you real. I'm not capable of imagining you in all your complexity and... perfection. As you really were. You're the best I can do. And you're not real.

Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-

ARIADNE
No!

A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.

COBB
What're you doing?
ARIADNE
Improvising.
She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-

Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes 5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns to his father, but his father is dead.

That’s the kick-you have to go!
ARIADNE
You’re coming!

No, I’m not. I’m staying here to find Saito.

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat. Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around Saito’s belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne GRABS Arthur’s elbow, pulling him away...

EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER
Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.
BROWNING

Saito REMEMBERS, nods...
SAITO
Waiting to die alone, yes.
Cobb is STARING at something on the table.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes. Do you need immigration forms?

Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle greetings with Eames and Yusuf.
